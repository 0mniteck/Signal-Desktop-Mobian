That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function, link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.  After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.  That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.

If it runs out of bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the \"subordinate\" pointer in the bridge's pci_dev remains NULL.  The PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL subordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.  Bandwidth control of unusable devices below the bridge is of questionable utility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe hotplug does since commit 62e4492c3063 (\"PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp probe\").  The PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of bus numbers.  PCIe hotplug emits an additional message with KERN_ERR severity to inform the user that hotplug functionality is disabled at the bridge.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.  In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call() also re-acquires RTNL.  In the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove the bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL and wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.  Thread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(), which may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by Thread B.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:    1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()   2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()   3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()   4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()  3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move 1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().  Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better performed before RTNL.

If one of the locks aren't readily available, it may lead to dropping the current runqueue lock and reacquiring both the locks at once. During this window it is possible that the task is already migrated and is running on some other CPU. These cases are already handled. However, if the task is migrated and has already been executed and another CPU is now trying to wake it up (ttwu) such that it is queued again on the runqeue (on_rq is 1) and also if the task was run by the same CPU, then the current checks will pass even though the task was migrated out and is no longer in the pushable tasks list.  Crashes ======= This bug resulted in quite a few flavors of crashes triggering kernel panics with various crash signatures such as assert failures, page faults, null pointer dereferences, and queue corruption errors all coming from scheduler itself.

When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in br_multicast_add_router.part.0+0x3f1/0x560\nWrite of size 8 at addr ffff888004a67328 by task ip/384\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack\n---truncated---","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38248","epss":0.00026,"percentile":0.0553,"date":"2025-08-23"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.41-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38248","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-d8cf34278f12abae","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.41-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.41-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38261","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38261","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  riscv: save the SR_SUM status over switches  When threads/tasks are switched we need to ensure the old execution's SR_SUM state is saved and the new thread has the old SR_SUM state restored.

Considered too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].  2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a netem.  3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this safeguard.  4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

The subsequent field[1] access and\ndereference causes the crash.\n\n  Usage Page (Vendor Defined 0xFF00)\n  Usage (0x0F)\n  Collection (Application)\n    Report ID (1)\n    Usage (0x01)\n    Logical Minimum (0)\n    Logical Maximum (255)\n    Report Size (8)\n    Report Count (1)\n    Feature (Data,Var,Abs)\n\n    Usage (0x02)\n    Logical Maximum (32767)\n    Report Size (16)\n    Report Count (1)\n    Feature (Data,Var,Abs)\n\n    Report ID (3)\n    Usage (0x03)\n    Logical Minimum (0)\n    Logical Maximum (1)\n    Report Size (8)\n    Report Count (1)\n    Feature (Data,Var,Abs)\n  End Collection\n\nHere we see the KASAN splat when the kernel dereferences the\nNULL pointer and crashes:\n\n  [   15.164723] Oops: general protection fault, probably for non-canonical address 0xdffffc0000000006: 0000 [#1] SMP KASAN NOPTI\n  [   15.165691] KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000030-0x0000000000000037]\n  [   15.165691] CPU: 0 UID: 0 PID: 10 Comm: kworker/0:1 Not tainted 6.15.0 #31 PREEMPT(voluntary)\n  [   15.165691] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.16.2-debian-1.16.2-1 04/01/2014\n  [   15.165691] RIP: 0010:apple_magic_backlight_report_set+0xbf/0x210\n  [   15.165691] Call Trace:\n  [   15.165691]  <TASK>\n  [   15.165691]  apple_probe+0x571/0xa20\n  [   15.165691]  hid_device_probe+0x2e2/0x6f0\n  [   15.165691]  really_probe+0x1ca/0x5c0\n  [   15.165691]  __driver_probe_device+0x24f/0x310\n  [   15.165691]  driver_probe_device+0x4a/0xd0\n  [   15.165691]  __device_attach_driver+0x169/0x220\n  [   15.165691]  bus_for_each_drv+0x118/0x1b0\n  [   15.165691]  __device_attach+0x1d5/0x380\n  [   15.165691]  device_initial_probe+0x12/0x20\n  [   15.165691]  bus_probe_device+0x13d/0x180\n  [   15.165691]  device_add+0xd87/0x1510\n  [...]\n\nTo fix this issue we should validate the number of fields that the\nbacklight and power reports have and if they do not have the required\nnumber of fields then bail.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38557","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.0278,"date":"2025-08-23"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.41-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38557","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-d8cf34278f12abae","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.41-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.41-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.41-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38559","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38559","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  platform/x86/intel/pmt: fix a crashlog NULL pointer access  Usage of the intel_pmt_read() for binary sysfs, requires a pcidev.

It returns the stale 'ret' value from    earlier operations instead of indicating the EFI failure.  2. When efi.get_variable() returns EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, it updates    *out_len to the required buffer size but writes no data to the output    buffer. However, due to bug #1, gmin_get_var_int() believes the call    succeeded.  The caller gmin_get_var_int() then performs: - Allocates val[CFG_VAR_NAME_MAX + 1] (65 bytes) on stack - Calls gmin_get_config_var(dev, is_gmin, var, val, &len) with len=64 - If EFI variable is >64 bytes, efi.get_variable() sets len=required_size - Due to bug #1, thinks call succeeded with len=required_size - Executes val[len] = 0, writing past end of 65-byte stack buffer  This creates a stack buffer overflow when EFI variables are larger than 64 bytes.

However, the state might have been freed by the time of this lookup.  Currently, if the state is not found, only a counter is incremented. The secpath (sp) extension on the skb is not removed, resulting in sp->len becoming 0.  Subsequently, functions like __xfrm_policy_check() attempt to access fields such as xfrm_input_state(skb)->xso.type (which dereferences sp->xvec[sp->len - 1]) without first validating sp->len. This leads to a crash when dereferencing an invalid state pointer.  This patch prevents the crash by explicitly removing the secpath extension from the skb if the xfrm state is not found after hardware decryption. This ensures downstream functions do not operate on a zero-length secpath.

Fix this by walking all child buses and deallocating all its IRQ resources before calling pci_hp_remove_devices().
