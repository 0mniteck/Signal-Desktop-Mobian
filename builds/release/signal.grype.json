This can result in a race condition that may overwrite the expected results with those of another query, causing the call to Scan to return either unexpected results from the other query or an error.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-47907","epss":0.00041,"percentile":0.11372,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.23.12","1.24.6"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.029724999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.24.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.24.4"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-47907","versionConstraint":"< 1.23.12,>= 1.24.0, < 1.24.6 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.24.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-go-module-stdlib-3aacb5d31edb1908","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.24.4","type":"go-module","locations":null,"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.24.4:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.24.4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-24975","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-24975","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24975","epss":0.00581,"percentile":0.67894,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.029050000000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-24975","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24975","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/git/git/blob/2dc94da3744bfbbf145eca587a0f5ff480cc5867/Documentation/git-clone.txt#L185-L191","https://lore.kernel.org/git/xmqq4k14qe9g.fsf%40gitster.g/","https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/","https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/","https://github.com/git/git/blob/2dc94da3744bfbbf145eca587a0f5ff480cc5867/Documentation/git-clone.txt#L185-L191","https://www.aquasec.com/blog/undetected-hard-code-secrets-expose-corporations/","https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2022/02/11/gitbleed/"],"description":"The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the \"GitBleed\" issue.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal.

vulnerability was found in GNU Binutils 2.43. It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function xstrdup of the file libiberty/xmalloc.c of the component ld. The manipulation leads to memory leak. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used.

procps is vulnerable to a process hiding through race condition. Since the kernel's proc_pid_readdir() returns PID entries in ascending numeric order, a process occupying a high PID can use inotify events to determine when the process list is being scanned, and fork/exec to obtain a lower PID, thus avoiding enumeration. An unprivileged attacker can hide a process from procps-ng's utilities by exploiting a race condition in reading /proc/PID entries.

All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21709","epss":0.00037,"percentile":0.09717,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21709","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21751","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21751","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21751","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.0741,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.024480000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-21751","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-21751","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1ce840c7a659aa53a31ef49f0271b4fd0dc10296","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/23a86c76a1a197e8fbbbd0ce3e826eb58c471624"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect\n\nCurrently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,\nthe error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns\nan error, which continues running the calling function and eventually\nfrees the matcher that is being disconnected.\nThis leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,\nwhich in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.\n\nThis patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when\nsome FW command fails during disconnect.\n\nNote that we're dealing here with FW error.

If it runs out\nof bus numbers, no pci_bus is allocated and the \"subordinate\" pointer in\nthe bridge's pci_dev remains NULL.\n\nThe PCIe bandwidth controller erroneously does not check for a NULL\nsubordinate pointer and dereferences it on probe.\n\nBandwidth control of unusable devices below the bridge is of questionable\nutility, so simply error out instead.  This mirrors what PCIe hotplug does\nsince commit 62e4492c3063 (\"PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp\nprobe\").\n\nThe PCI core emits a message with KERN_INFO severity if it has run out of\nbus numbers.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: fix block group refcount race in btrfs_create_pending_block_groups()\n\nBlock group creation is done in two phases, which results in a slightly\nunintuitive property: a block group can be allocated/deallocated from\nafter btrfs_make_block_group() adds it to the space_info with\nbtrfs_add_bg_to_space_info(), but before creation is completely completed\nin btrfs_create_pending_block_groups(). As a result, it is possible for a\nblock group to go unused and have 'btrfs_mark_bg_unused' called on it\nconcurrently with 'btrfs_create_pending_block_groups'. This causes a\nnumber of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag\n'BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW'.\n\nHowever, this fix is not quite complete. Since it does not use the\nunused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:\n\nbtrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused\n                                           if list_empty // false\n        list_del_init\n        clear_bit\n                                           else if (test_bit) // true\n                                                list_move_tail\n\nAnd we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs\nstate for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to\nprevent.\n\nThe broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:\n\n  [1272.943527] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n  [1272.943967] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 61 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.944731] Modules linked in: btrfs virtio_net xor zstd_compress raid6_pq null_blk [last unloaded: btrfs]\n  [1272.945550] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 61 Comm: kworker/u32:1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.14.0-rc5+ #108\n  [1272.946368] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n  [1272.946585] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014\n  [1272.947273] Workqueue: btrfs_discard btrfs_discard_workfn [btrfs]\n  [1272.947788] RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.949532] RSP: 0018:ffffbf1200247df0 EFLAGS: 00010282\n  [1272.949901] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa14b00e3f800 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  [1272.950437] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffbf1200247c78 RDI: 00000000ffffdfff\n  [1272.950986] RBP: ffffa14b00dc2860 R08: 00000000ffffdfff R09: ffffffff90526268\n  [1272.951512] R10: ffffffff904762c0 R11: 0000000063666572 R12: ffffa14b00dc28c0\n  [1272.952024] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffa14b00dc2868 R15: 000001285dcd12c0\n  [1272.952850] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa14d33c40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [1272.953458] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [1272.953931] CR2: 00007f838cbda000 CR3: 000000010104e000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  [1272.954474] Call Trace:\n  [1272.954655]  <TASK>\n  [1272.954812]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955173]  ? __warn.cold+0x93/0xd7\n  [1272.955487]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955816]  ? report_bug+0xe7/0x120\n  [1272.956103]  ? handle_bug+0x53/0x90\n  [1272.956424]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x13/0x60\n  [1272.956700]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [1272.957011]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.957399]  btrfs_discard_cancel_work.cold+0x26/0x2b [btrfs]\n  [1272.957853]  btrfs_put_block_group.cold+0x5d/0x8e [btrfs]\n  [1272.958289]  btrfs_discard_workfn+0x194/0x380 [btrfs]\n  [1272.958729]  process_one_work+0x130/0x290\n  [1272.959026]  worker_thread+0x2ea/0x420\n  [1272.959335]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.959644]  kthread+0xd7/0x1c0\n  [1272.959872]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960172]  ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n  [1272.960474]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960745]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n  [1272.961035]  </TASK>\n  [1272.961238] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nThough we have seen them in the async discard workfn as well.

In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37743","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.05872,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37743","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37746","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37746","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37746","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.05872,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0135},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-37746","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-37746","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Unknown","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/7f35b429802a8065aa61e2a3f567089649f4d98e","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/a71c6fc87b2b9905dc2e38887fe4122287216be9"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/dwc_pcie: fix duplicate pci_dev devices\n\nDuring platform_device_register, wrongly using struct device\npci_dev as platform_data caused a kmemdup copy of pci_dev.

This wasn't caught in testing\nbecause in this case the leftover rseq_cs does point to a valid struct\nrseq_cs.\n\nWhat we can do is clear the rseq_cs field on registration when it's\nnon-zero which will prevent segfaults on registration and won't break\nthe glibc versions that reuse rseq areas on thread creation.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38067","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.0828,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38067","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38104","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38104","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38104","epss":0.00026,"percentile":0.05529,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.013},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-38104","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38104","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Unknown","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/07ed75bfa7ede8bfcfa303fd6efc85db1c8684c7","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1c0378830e42c98acd69e0289882c8637d92f285","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/5c1741a0c176ae11675a64cb7f2dd21d72db6b91","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dc0297f3198bd60108ccbd167ee5d9fa4af31ed0"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amdgpu: Replace Mutex with Spinlock for RLCG register access to avoid Priority Inversion in SRIOV\n\nRLCG Register Access is a way for virtual functions to safely access GPU\nregisters in a virtualized environment., including TLB flushes and\nregister reads. When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same\nregisters simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the\nRLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This\nmeans that only one thread can access the registers at a time,\npreventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed\ncorrectly. Additionally, when a low-priority task holds a mutex that a\nhigh-priority task needs, ie., If a thread holding a spinlock tries to\nacquire a mutex, it can lead to priority inversion. register access in\namdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw especially in a fast code path is critical.\n\nThe call stack shows that the function amdgpu_virt_rlcg_reg_rw is being\ncalled, which attempts to acquire the mutex.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbridge: mcast: Fix use-after-free during router port configuration\n\nThe bridge maintains a global list of ports behind which a multicast\nrouter resides. The list is consulted during forwarding to ensure\nmulticast packets are forwarded to these ports even if the ports are not\nmember in the matching MDB entry.\n\nWhen per-VLAN multicast snooping is enabled, the per-port multicast\ncontext is disabled on each port and the port is removed from the global\nrouter port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the global list even when per-VLAN\nmulticast snooping is enabled:\n\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 0\n # ip link set dev dummy1 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n $ bridge -d mdb show | grep router\n router ports on br1: dummy1\n\nSince commit 4b30ae9adb04 (\"net: bridge: mcast: re-implement\nbr_multicast_{enable, disable}_port functions\"), when per-VLAN multicast\nsnooping is enabled, multicast disablement on a port will disable the\nper-{port, VLAN} multicast contexts and not the per-port one. As a\nresult, a port will remain in the global router port list even after it\nis deleted. This will lead to a use-after-free [1] when the list is\ntraversed (when adding a new port to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link del dev dummy1\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # ip link set dev dummy2 type bridge_slave mcast_router 2\n\nSimilarly, stale entries can also be found in the per-VLAN router port\nlist. When per-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled, the per-{port, VLAN}\ncontexts are disabled on each port and the port is removed from the\nper-VLAN router port list:\n\n # ip link add name br1 up type bridge vlan_filtering 1 mcast_snooping 1 mcast_vlan_snooping 1\n # ip link add name dummy1 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan global set vid 2 dev br1 mcast_snooping 1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n # ip link set dev br1 type bridge mcast_vlan_snooping 0\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n\nHowever, the port can be re-added to the per-VLAN list even when\nper-VLAN multicast snooping is disabled:\n\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 0\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy1 mcast_router 2\n $ bridge vlan global show dev br1 vid 2 | grep router\n       router ports: dummy1\n\nWhen the VLAN is deleted from the port, the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext will not be disabled since multicast snooping is not enabled\non the VLAN. As a result, the port will remain in the per-VLAN router\nport list even after it is no longer member in the VLAN. This will lead\nto a use-after-free [2] when the list is traversed (when adding a new\nport to the list, for example):\n\n # ip link add name dummy2 up master br1 type dummy\n # bridge vlan add vid 2 dev dummy2\n # bridge vlan del vid 2 dev dummy1\n # bridge vlan set vid 2 dev dummy2 mcast_router 2\n\nFix these issues by removing the port from the relevant (global or\nper-VLAN) router port list in br_multicast_port_ctx_deinit(). The\nfunction is invoked during port deletion with the per-port multicast\ncontext and during VLAN deletion with the per-{port, VLAN} multicast\ncontext.\n\nNote that deleting the multicast router timer is not enough as it only\ntakes care of the temporary multicast router states (1 or 3) and not the\npermanent one (2).\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in

put_user() in schedule_tail\n(kernel/sched/core.c) doing the following:\n\nasmlinkage __visible void schedule_tail(struct task_struct *prev)\n{\n...\n        if (current->set_child_tid)\n                put_user(task_pid_vnr(current), current->set_child_tid);\n...\n}\n\nthe put_user() macro causes the code sequence to come out as follows:\n\n1:\t__enable_user_access()\n2:\treg = task_pid_vnr(current);\n3:\t*current->set_child_tid = reg;\n4:\t__disable_user_access()\n\nThe problem is that we may have a sleeping function as argument which\ncould clear SR_SUM causing the panic above. This was fixed by\nevaluating the argument of the put_user() macro outside the user-enabled\nsection in commit 285a76bb2cf5 (\"riscv: evaluate put_user() arg before\nenabling user access\")\"\n\nIn order for riscv to take advantage of unsafe_get/put_XXX() macros and\nto avoid the same issue we had with put_user() and sleeping functions we\nmust ensure code flow can go through switch_to() from within a region of\ncode with SR_SUM enabled and come back with SR_SUM still enabled. This\npatch addresses the problem allowing future work to enable full use of\nunsafe_get/put_XXX() macros without needing to take a CSR bit flip cost\non every access. Make switch_to() save and restore SR_SUM.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38261","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05163,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38261","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38272","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38272","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38272","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.0473,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-38272","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38272","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Unknown","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1237c2d4a8db79dfd4369bff6930b0e385ed7d5c","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/2dbccf1eb8c04b84ee3afdb1d6b787db02e7befc"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: dsa: b53: do not enable EEE on bcm63xx\n\nBCM63xx internal switches do not support EEE, but provide multiple RGMII\nports where external PHYs may be connected.

Alternatively, KVM could filter out \"bad\"\nGVAs before inserting into the FIFO, but practically speaking the only\ndownside of pushing validation to the final processing is that doing so\nis suboptimal for the guest, and no well-behaved guest will request TLB\nflushes for non-canonical addresses.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38351","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.03984,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38351","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38359","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38359","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38359","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.0473,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-38359","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38359","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Unknown","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/11709abccf93b08adde95ef313c300b0d4bc28f1","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/d2e317dfd2d1fe416c77315d17c5d57dbe374915"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/mm: Fix in_atomic() handling in do_secure_storage_access()\n\nKernel user spaces accesses to not exported pages in atomic context\nincorrectly try to resolve the page fault.\nWith debug options enabled call traces like this can be seen:\n\nBUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1523\nin_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 419074, name: qemu-system-s39\npreempt_count: 1, expected: 0\nRCU nest depth: 0, expected: 0\nINFO: lockdep is turned off.\nPreemption disabled at:\n[<00000383ea47cfa2>] copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0xa2/0x8a0\nCPU: 12 UID: 0 PID: 419074 Comm: qemu-system-s39\nTainted: G        W           6.16.0-20250531.rc0.git0.69b3a602feac.63.fc42.s390x+debug #1 PREEMPT\nTainted: [W]=WARN\nHardware name: IBM 3931 A01 703 (LPAR)\nCall Trace:\n [<00000383e990d282>] dump_stack_lvl+0xa2/0xe8\n [<00000383e99bf152>] __might_resched+0x292/0x2d0\n [<00000383eaa7c374>] down_read+0x34/0x2d0\n [<00000383e99432f8>] do_secure_storage_access+0x108/0x360\n [<00000383eaa724b0>] __do_pgm_check+0x130/0x220\n [<00000383eaa842e4>] pgm_check_handler+0x114/0x160\n [<00000383ea47d028>] copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0x128/0x8a0\n([<00000383ea47d016>] copy_page_from_iter_atomic+0x116/0x8a0)\n [<00000383e9c45eae>] generic_perform_write+0x16e/0x310\n [<00000383e9eb87f4>] ext4_buffered_write_iter+0x84/0x160\n [<00000383e9da0de4>] vfs_write+0x1c4/0x460\n [<00000383e9da123c>] ksys_write+0x7c/0x100\n [<00000383eaa7284e>] __do_syscall+0x15e/0x280\n [<00000383eaa8417e>] system_call+0x6e/0x90\nINFO: lockdep is turned off.\n\nIt is not allowed to take the mmap_lock while in atomic context.

However grafting is\nperformed after qdisc_create (and thus the qdiscs' init callback) is\nexecuted. In qdiscs that eventually call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog\nduring init or change (such as fq, hhf, choke, etc), an issue\narises. For example, executing the following commands:\n\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo root handle a: htb default 2\nsudo tc qdisc add dev lo parent a: handle beef fq\n\nQdiscs such as fq, hhf, choke, etc unconditionally invoke\nqdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() in their control path init() or change() which\nthen causes a failure to find the child class; however, that does not stop\nthe unconditional invocation of the assumed child qdisc's qlen_notify with\na null class. All these qdiscs make the assumption that class is non-null.\n\nThe solution is ensure that qdisc_leaf() which looks up the parent\nclass, and is invoked prior to qdisc_create(), should return failure on\nnot finding the class.\nIn this patch, we leverage qdisc_leaf to return ERR_PTRs whenever the\nparentid doesn't correspond to a class, so that we can detect it\nearlier on and abort before qdisc_create is called.\n\n[1]

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\natm: clip: Fix infinite recursive call of clip_push().\n\nsyzbot reported the splat below. [0]\n\nThis happens if we call ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) more than once.\n\nDuring the first call, clip_mkip() sets clip_push() to vcc->push(),\nand the second call copies it to clip_vcc->old_push().\n\nLater, when the socket is close()d, vcc_destroy_socket() passes\nNULL skb to clip_push(), which calls clip_vcc->old_push(),\ntriggering the infinite recursion.\n\nLet's prevent the second ioctl(ATMARP_MKIP) by checking\nvcc->user_back, which is allocated by the first call as clip_vcc.\n\nNote also that we use lock_sock() to prevent racy calls.\n\n[0]:\nBUG: TASK

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: Correct signedness in skb remaining space calculation\n\nSyzkaller reported a bug [1] where sk->sk_forward_alloc can overflow.\n\nWhen we send data, if an skb exists at the tail of the write queue, the\nkernel will attempt to append the new data to that skb. However, the code\nthat checks for available space in the skb is flawed:\n'''\ncopy = size_goal - skb->len\n'''\n\nThe types of the variables involved are:\n'''\ncopy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)\nsize_goal: int\nskb->len: unsigned int\n'''\n\nDue to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an\nunsigned int to match skb->len before the subtraction. The result is an\nunsigned int.\n\nWhen this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,\nit is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy\nis always >= 0.\n\nAssume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a\nvalue smaller than skb->len. The subtraction will result in copy holding a\nvery large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is\nused to update sk->sk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.\n\nThe syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this\ncondition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The\ntcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small\nvalue. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set\nsk->sk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory\nallocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and\nbecome negative.\n\n[1]: https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?extid=de6565462ab540f50e47","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38463","epss":0.00023,"percentile":0.04374,"date":"2025-08-09"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"13"},"package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.12.38-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-38463","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-9c40116ab97a0ef1","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.12.38-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.12.38-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.12.38-1?arch=all&distro=debian-13&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-38464","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-38464","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:13","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-38464","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.07255,"date":"2025-08-09"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.016},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-38464","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-38464","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Unknown","urls":["https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/03dcdd2558e1e55bf843822fe4363dcb48743f2b","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/15a6f4971e2f157d57e09ea748d1fbc714277aa4","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/1dbf7cd2454a28b1da700085b99346b5445aeabb","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/3b89e17b2fd64012682bed158d9eb3d2e96dec42","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/50aa2d121bc2cfe2d825f8a331ea75dfaaab6a50","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/667eeab4999e981c96b447a4df5f20bdf5c26f13","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/be4b8392da7978294f2f368799d29dd509fb6c4d","https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/dab8ded2e5ff41012a6ff400b44dbe76ccf3592a"],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntipc: Fix use-after-free in tipc_conn_close().\n\nsyzbot reported a null-ptr-deref in tipc_conn_close() during netns\ndismantle.

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsmc: Fix various oops due to inet_sock type confusion.\n\nsyzbot reported weird splats [0][1] in cipso_v4_sock_setattr() while\nfreeing inet_sk(sk)->inet_opt.\n\nThe address was freed multiple times even though it was read-only memory.\n\ncipso_v4_sock_setattr() did nothing wrong, and the root cause was type\nconfusion.\n\nThe cited commit made it possible to create smc_sock as an INET socket.\n\nThe issue is that struct smc_sock does not have struct inet_sock as the\nfirst member but hijacks AF_INET and AF_INET6 sk_family, which confuses\nvarious places.\n\nIn this case, inet_sock.inet_opt was actually smc_sock.clcsk_data_ready(),\nwhich is an address of a function in the text segment.\n\n  $ pahole -C inet_sock vmlinux\n  struct inet_sock {\n  ...\n          struct ip_options_rcu *    inet_opt;             /*   784     8 */\n\n  $ pahole -C smc_sock vmlinux\n  struct smc_sock {\n  ...\n          void                       (*clcsk_data_ready)(struct sock *); /*   784     8 */\n\nThe same issue for another field was reported before. [2][3]\n\nAt that time, an ugly hack was suggested [4], but it makes both INET\nand SMC code error-prone and hard to change.\n\nAlso, yet another variant was fixed by a hacky commit 98d4435efcbf3\n(\"net/smc: prevent NULL pointer dereference in txopt_get\").\n\nInstead of papering over the root cause by such hacks, we should not\nallow non-INET socket to reuse the INET infra.\n\nLet's add inet_sock as the first member of smc_sock.\n\n[0]:\nkvfree_call_rcu(): Double-freed call. rcu_head 000000006921da73\nWARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 6718 at mm/slab_common.c:1956

However, if `insn->n` is 0 (which is allowable for\n`INSN_READ` and `INSN_WRITE` instructions, then `data[0]` may contain\nuninitialized data, and certainly contains invalid data, possibly from a\ndifferent instruction in the array of instructions handled by\n`do_insnlist_ioctl()`.  This will result in an incorrect value being\nwritten to the digital output channel (or to the digital input/output\nchannel if configured as an output), and may be reflected in the\ninternal saved state of the channel.\n\nFix it by returning 0 early if `insn->n` is 0, before reaching the code\nthat accesses `data[0]`.

When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,\nthe operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),\nthe function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes\nwhen the driver later accesses the freed memory.\n\nThis results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto\ndriver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel\ncrashes with NULL pointer dereferences.\n\nThe issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't\nguarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in\nthe mask, async implementations can be selected.\n\nFix by restoring the async crypto handling:\n- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking\n- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification\n- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion\n\nThis ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto
