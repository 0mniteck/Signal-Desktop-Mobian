Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98417,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":49.97625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.19.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.19.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-go-module-stdlib-c00bda177027429b","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.19.8","type":"go-module","locations":null,"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.19.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.19.8","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-35176","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-35176","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"REXML is an XML toolkit for Ruby.

They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","epss":0.00011,"percentile":0.00999,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["252.38-1~deb12u1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5931-1"}],"risk":0.005335},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"systemd","version":"252.36-1~deb12u1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 252.38-1~deb12u1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-4598"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"252.38-1~deb12u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-systemd-sysv-1481fca6fc633693","name":"systemd-sysv","version":"252.36-1~deb12u1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0 AND LicenseRef-Expat AND GPL-2.0-only AND GPL-2.0-or-later AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LGPL-2.1-or-later AND LicenseRef-public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:systemd-sysv:systemd-sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd-sysv:systemd_sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd_sysv:systemd-sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd_sysv:systemd_sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd:systemd-sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:systemd:systemd_sysv:252.36-1~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/systemd-sysv@252.36-1~deb12u1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-31852","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-31852","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"LLVM before 18.1.3 generates code in which the LR register can be overwritten without data being saved to the stack, and thus there can sometimes be an exploitable error in the flow of control.

In particular, accesses were permitted above state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the stack was already \"large enough\", the access was permitted, but otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to \"grow the stack\". This undesired rejection was happening in two places: - in check_stack_slot_within_bounds() - in check_stack_range_initialized() This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it can't run unprivileged for other reasons.  This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime because a too small stack had been allocated for it.  Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access() was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used instead.  This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size. check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.  A few tests were changed to also check the stack depth computation. The one that fails without this patch is verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-52452","epss":0.00013,"percentile":0.0132,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.009944999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52452"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-52485","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-52485","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: Wake DMCUB before sending a command  [Why] We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't powered on.

[How] We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command, but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.  Fixing this issue involves the following:  1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start    the process to exit idle or notify idle.  It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.  2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper    that maintains this SW state.  This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.  3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or    waiting for DMCUB idle.  This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-52625","epss":0.00011,"percentile":0.00928,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.005775000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-52625"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-52629","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-52629","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  sh: push-switch: Reorder cleanup operations to avoid use-after-free bug  The original code puts flush_work() before timer_shutdown_sync() in switch_drv_remove().

The arithmetic implies adding together a 64-bit register with a int offset. The register was checked to be below 1<<29 when it was variable, but not when it was fixed. The offset either comes from an instruction (in which case it is 16 bit), from another register (in which case the caller checked it to be below 1<<29 [1]), or from the size of an argument to a kfunc (in which case it can be a u32 [2]). Between the register being inconsistently checked to be below 1<<29, and the offset being up to an u32, it appears that we were open to overflowing the `int`s which were currently used for arithmetic.

If overflow is detected, CPU switches to `shadow_stack` temporarily before switching finally to per-cpu `overflow_stack`.  If two CPUs/harts are racing and end up in over flowing kernel stack, one or both will end up corrupting each other state because `shadow_stack` is not per-cpu. This patch optimizes per-cpu overflow stack switch by directly picking per-cpu `overflow_stack` and gets rid of `shadow_stack`.  Following are the changes in this patch   - Defines an asm macro to obtain per-cpu symbols in destination    register.  - In entry.S, when overflow is detected, per-cpu overflow stack is    located using per-cpu asm macro. Computing per-cpu symbol requires    a temporary register. x31 is saved away into CSR_SCRATCH    (CSR_SCRATCH is anyways zero since we're in kernel).

Each port including the endpoint port is attached to the cxl_port driver.  Given that setup, it follows that when either any port in that lineage goes through a cxl_port ->remove() event, or the memdev goes through a cxl_mem ->remove() event. The hierarchy below the removed port, or the entire hierarchy if the memdev is removed needs to come down.  The delete_endpoint() callback is careful to check whether it is being called to tear down the hierarchy, or if it is only being called to teardown the memdev because an ancestor port is going through ->remove().  That care needs to take the device_lock() of the endpoint's parent.

To make this work reliably, we push extra per-instruction flags into instruction history, encoding stack slot index (spi) and stack frame number in extra 10 bit flags we take away from prev_idx in instruction history. We don't touch idx field for maximum performance, as it's checked most frequently during backtracking.  This change removes basically the last remaining practical limitation of precision backtracking logic in BPF verifier. It fixes known deficiencies, but also opens up new opportunities to reduce number of verified states, explored in the subsequent patches.  There are only three differences in selftests' BPF object files according to veristat, all in the positive direction (less states).

Notice also cur_hist_entry pointer reset to NULL at the beginning of instruction verification loop. This pointer avoids the problem of relying on last jump history entry's insn_idx to determine whether we already have entry for current instruction or not. It can happen that we added jump history entry because current instruction is_jmp_point(), but also we need to add instruction flags for stack access. In this case, we don't want to entries, so we need to reuse last added entry, if it is present.  Relying on insn_idx comparison has the same ambiguity problem as the one that was fixed recently in [0], so we avoid that.

The stack then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the 'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a 'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.  However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be reproduced using [2].  Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay. Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}' command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a filter block or being unbound from one.  As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains() in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

The ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to handle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295, which are described in:  * https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en * https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en  In both cases the workaround is described as:  | If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the | kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected | cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses: | | 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including |    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`. | | 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.  The important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed \"after all explicit memory accesses\".  Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by an LDR, as we have:  | alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD | \ttlbi\tvale1, xzr | \tdsb\tnsh | alternative_else_nop_endif | alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 | \tldr\tlr, [sp, #S_LR] | \tadd\tsp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE\t\t// restore sp | \teret | alternative_else_nop_endif | | [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]  This patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB immediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.  The ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives cannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch to skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:  | alternative_insn \"b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\\@\", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 | \t[ ...

this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the erratum:  | Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the | issue from occurring.  ... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround is only necessary \"If pagetable isolation is disabled\".","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-26670","epss":0.00012,"percentile":0.01172,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0063},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-26670"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-26672","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26672","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amdgpu: Fix variable 'mca_funcs' dereferenced before NULL check in 'amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry()'  Fixes the below:  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_mca.c:377 amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'mca_funcs' (see line 368)  357 int amdgpu_mca_smu_get_mca_entry(struct amdgpu_device *adev, \t\t\t\t     enum amdgpu_mca_error_type type, 358                                  int idx, struct mca_bank_entry *entry) 359 { 360         const struct amdgpu_mca_smu_funcs *mca_funcs = \t\t\t\t\t\tadev->mca.mca_funcs;

Unfortunately, I need to read more code before I can refacter the handler of 'mddev->ro' in dm-raid, hence let's fix the problem the easy way for now to prevent dm-raid regression.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-26757","epss":0.00012,"percentile":0.01088,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0063},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-26757"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-26758","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-26758","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  md: Don't ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery()  mddev_suspend() never stop sync_thread, hence it doesn't make sense to ignore suspended array in md_check_recovery(), which might cause sync_thread can't be unregistered.

When HW platform has more then 64 cpus, system will crash on these platforms. MAX_CORE_PIC is the maximum cpu number in MADT table (max physical number) which can exceed the supported maximum cpu number (NR_CPUS, max logical number), but kernel should not crash. Kernel should boot cpus with NR_CPUS, let the remainder cpus stay in BIOS.  The potential crash reason is that the array acpi_core_pic[NR_CPUS] can be overflowed when parsing MADT table, and it is obvious that CORE_PIC should be corresponding to physical core rather than logical core, so it is better to define the array as acpi_core_pic[MAX_CORE_PIC].  With the patch, system can boot up 64 vcpus with qemu parameter -smp 128, otherwise system will crash with the following message.

The ->probe() function of the cadence-quadspi driver then sets the device drvdata to store the address of the \"struct cqspi_st\" structure. Therefore:  \tstruct cqspi_st *cqspi = dev_get_drvdata(dev);  is correct, but:  \tstruct spi_controller *host = dev_get_drvdata(dev);  is not, as it makes \"host\" point not to a \"struct spi_controller\" but to the same \"struct cqspi_st\" structure as above.  This obviously leads to bad things (memory corruption, kernel crashes) directly during ->probe(), as ->probe() enables the device using PM runtime, leading the ->runtime_resume() hook being called, which in turns calls spi_controller_resume() with the wrong pointer.  This has at least been reported [0] to cause a kernel crash, but the exact behavior will depend on the memory contents.

For md/raid, the problem doesn't exist because register new sync_thread doesn't rely on the IO to be done any more:  1) If array is read-only, it can switch to read-write by ioctl/sysfs; 2) md/raid never set MD_RECOVERY_WAIT; 3) If MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set, mddev_suspend() doesn't hold    'reconfig_mutex', hence it can be cleared and reshape can continue by    sysfs api 'sync_action'.  However, I'm not sure yet how to avoid the problem in dm-raid yet.

The existing set iterator skips inactive elements in the next generation, this does not work from the abort path to restore the original state since it has to skip active elements instead (not inactive ones).  This patch moves the check for inactive elements to the set iterator callback, then it reverses the logic for the .activate case which needs to skip active elements.

Since we're copying the fiemap extent to user space on every iteration we have the chance of pagefaulting.

To fix this simply don't take the extent lock for the entire duration of the fiemap.  This is safe in general because we keep track of where we are when we're searching the tree, so if an ordered extent updates in the middle of our fiemap call we'll still emit the correct extents because we know what offset we were on before.  The only place we maintain the lock is searching delalloc.  Since the delalloc stuff can change during writeback we want to lock the extent range so we have a consistent view of delalloc at the time we're checking to see if we need to set the delalloc flag.

E.g., for multi-kprobes and multi-uprobes, link is used to fetch BPF cookie values.  Because of this runtime dependency, when bpf_link refcnt drops to zero there could still be active BPF programs running accessing link data.  This patch adds generic support to defer bpf_link dealloc callback to after RCU GP, if requested. This is done by exposing two different deallocation callbacks, one synchronous and one deferred. If deferred one is provided, bpf_link_free() will schedule dealloc_deferred() callback to happen after RCU GP.  BPF is using two flavors of RCU: \"classic\" non-sleepable one and RCU tasks trace one. The latter is used when sleepable BPF programs are used. bpf_link_free() accommodates that by checking underlying BPF program's sleepable flag, and goes either through normal RCU GP only for non-sleepable, or through RCU tasks trace GP *and* then normal RCU GP (taking into account rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() optimization), if BPF program is sleepable.  We use this for multi-kprobe and multi-uprobe links, which dereference link during program run. We also preventively switch raw_tp link to use deferred dealloc callback, as upcoming changes in bpf-next tree expose raw_tp link data (specifically, cookie value) to BPF program at runtime as well.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-35860","epss":0.00116,"percentile":0.31572,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.058},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-35860"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-35869","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-35869","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: guarantee refcounted children from parent session  Avoid potential use-after-free bugs when walking DFS referrals, mounting and performing DFS failover by ensuring that all children from parent @tcon->ses are also refcounted.

This leaves a gap in our checking, because we could end up with corruption on disk where WRITTEN isn't set on the leaf, and then the extended leaf checks don't get run which we rely on to validate all of the item pointers to make sure we don't access memory outside of the extent buffer.  However, since 732fab95abe2 (\"btrfs: check-integrity: remove CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_CHECK_INTEGRITY option\") we no longer call btrfs_check_leaf() from btrfs_mark_buffer_dirty(), which means we only ever call it on blocks that are being written out, and thus have WRITTEN set, or that are being read in, which should have WRITTEN set.  Add checks to make sure we have WRITTEN set appropriately, and then make sure __btrfs_check_leaf() always does the item checking.

However, HDRINCL can cause a race condition. If calling setsockopt(2) with IP_HDRINCL changes HDRINCL while __ip_make_skb() is running, the function will access icmphdr in the skb even if it is not included. This causes the issue reported by KMSAN.  Check FLOWI_FLAG_KNOWN_NH on fl4->flowi4_flags instead of testing HDRINCL on the socket.  Also, fl4->fl4_icmp_type and fl4->fl4_icmp_code are not initialized.

Now hci_conn_add() returns ERR_PTR() as it can fail due to the both a kzalloc failure and invalid MTU value.  divide error: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN NOPTI CPU: 0 PID: 67 Comm: kworker/u5:0 Tainted: G        W          6.9.0-rc5+ #20 Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.15.0-1 04/01/2014 Workqueue: hci0 hci_rx_work RIP: 0010:l2cap_le_flowctl_init+0x19e/0x3f0 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:547 Code: e8 17 17 0c 00 66 41 89 9f 84 00 00 00 bf 01 00 00 00 41 b8 02 00 00 00 4c 89 fe 4c 89 e2 89 d9 e8 27 17 0c 00 44 89 f0 31 d2 <66> f7 f3 89 c3 ff c3 4d 8d b7 88 00 00 00 4c 89 f0 48 c1 e8 03 42 RSP: 0018:ffff88810bc0f858 EFLAGS: 00010246 RAX: 00000000000002a0 RBX: 0000000000000000 RCX: dffffc0000000000 RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffff88810bc0f7c0 RDI: ffffc90002dcb66f RBP: ffff88810bc0f880 R08: aa69db2dda70ff01 R09: 0000ffaaaaaaaaaa R10: 0084000000ffaaaa R11: 0000000000000000 R12: ffff88810d65a084 R13: dffffc0000000000 R14: 00000000000002a0 R15: ffff88810d65a000 FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffff88811ac00000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000 CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033 CR2: 0000000020000100 CR3: 0000000103268003 CR4: 0000000000770ef0 PKRU: 55555554 Call Trace:  <TASK>  l2cap_le_connect_req net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:4902 [inline]  l2cap_le_sig_cmd net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:5420 [inline]  l2cap_le_sig_channel net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:5486 [inline]  l2cap_recv_frame+0xe59d/0x11710 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:6809  l2cap_recv_acldata+0x544/0x10a0 net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c:7506  hci_acldata_packet net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:3939 [inline]  hci_rx_work+0x5e5/0xb20 net/bluetooth/hci_core.c:4176  process_one_work kernel/workqueue.c:3254 [inline]  process_scheduled_works+0x90f/0x1530 kernel/workqueue.c:3335  worker_thread+0x926/0xe70 kernel/workqueue.c:3416  kthread+0x2e3/0x380 kernel/kthread.c:388  ret_from_fork+0x5c/0x90 arch/x86/kernel/process.c:147  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30 arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S:244  </TASK> Modules linked in: ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-36968","epss":0.00052,"percentile":0.16351,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.029899999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-36968"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-38557","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-38557","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net/mlx5: Reload only IB representors upon lag disable/enable  On lag disable, the bond IB device along with all of its representors are destroyed, and then the slaves' representors get reloaded.

Systems with earlier processors are much more stable.  Systems with PA8800 and PA8900 processors have a large L2 cache which needs per page flushing for decent performance when a large range is flushed. The combined cache in these systems is also more sensitive to non-equivalent aliases than the caches in earlier systems.  The majority of random segmentation faults that I have looked at appear to be memory corruption in memory allocated using mmap and malloc.  My first attempt at fixing the random faults didn't work. On reviewing the cache code, I realized that there were two issues which the existing code didn't handle correctly. Both relate to cache move-in. Another issue is that the present bit in PTEs is racy.  1) PA-RISC caches have a mind of their own and they can speculatively load data and instructions for a page as long as there is a entry in the TLB for the page which allows move-in. TLBs are local to each CPU. Thus, the TLB entry for a page must be purged before flushing the page. This is particularly important on SMP systems.  In some of the flush routines, the flush routine would be called and then the TLB entry would be purged. This was because the flush routine needed the TLB entry to do the flush.  2) My initial approach to trying the fix the random faults was to try and use flush_cache_page_if_present for all flush operations. This actually made things worse and led to a couple of hardware lockups. It finally dawned on me that some lines weren't being flushed because the pte check code was racy. This resulted in random inequivalent mappings to physical pages.  The __flush_cache_page tmpalias flush sets up its own TLB entry and it doesn't need the existing TLB entry. As long as we can find the pte pointer for the vm page, we can get the pfn and physical address of the page. We can also purge the TLB entry for the page before doing the flush. Further, __flush_cache_page uses a special TLB entry that inhibits cache move-in.  When switching page mappings, we need to ensure that lines are removed from the cache.  It is not sufficient to just flush the lines to memory as they may come back.  This made it clear that we needed to implement all the required flush operations using tmpalias routines. This includes flushes for user and kernel pages.  After modifying the code to use tmpalias flushes, it became clear that the random segmentation faults were not fully resolved. The frequency of faults was worse on systems with a 64 MB L2 (PA8900) and systems with more CPUs (rp4440).  The warning that I added to flush_cache_page_if_present to detect pages that couldn't be flushed triggered frequently on some systems.  Helge and I looked at the pages that couldn't be flushed and found that the PTE was either cleared or for a swap page. Ignoring pages that were swapped out seemed okay but pages with cleared PTEs seemed problematic.  I looked at routines related to pte_clear and noticed ptep_clear_flush. The default implementation just flushes the TLB entry. However, it was obvious that on parisc we need to flush the cache page as well. If we don't flush the cache page, stale lines will be left in the cache and cause random corruption. Once a PTE is cleared, there is no way to find the physical address associated with the PTE and flush the associated page at a later time.  I implemented an updated change with a parisc specific version of ptep_clear_flush. It fixed the random data corruption on Helge's rp4440 and rp3440, as well as on my c8000.  At this point, I realized that I could restore the code where we only flush in flush_cache_page_if_present if the page has been accessed. However, for this, we also need to flush the cache when the accessed bit is cleared in ---truncated---","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-40918","epss":0.00085,"percentile":0.26026,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.00425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-40918"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-40965","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-40965","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  i2c: lpi2c: Avoid calling clk_get_rate during transfer  Instead of repeatedly calling clk_get_rate for each transfer, lock the clock rate and cache the value.

On the 830 (8\") and 1050 (\"10\") models this regulator is controlled by a platform_device and x86_android_tablet_remove() removes platform_device-s before i2c_clients so the consumer gets removed first.  But on the 1380 (13\") model there is a lc824206xa micro-USB switch connected over I2C and the extcon driver for that controls the regulator. The bq24190 i2c-client *must* be registered first, because that creates the regulator with the lc824206xa listed as its consumer. If the regulator has not been registered yet the lc824206xa driver will end up getting a dummy regulator.  Since in this case both the regulator provider and consumer are I2C devices, the only way to ensure that the consumer is unregistered first is to unregister the I2C devices in reverse order of in which they were created.  For consistency and to avoid similar problems in the future change x86_android_tablet_remove() to unregister all device types in reverse order.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-40975","epss":0.00116,"percentile":0.31572,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.058},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-40975"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-40998","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-40998","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ext4: fix uninitialized ratelimit_state->lock access in __ext4_fill_super()  In the following concurrency we will access the uninitialized rs->lock:  ext4_fill_super   ext4_register_sysfs    // sysfs registered msg_ratelimit_interval_ms                              // Other processes modify rs->interval to                              // non-zero via msg_ratelimit_interval_ms   ext4_orphan_cleanup     ext4_msg(sb, KERN_INFO, \"Errors on filesystem, \"       __ext4_msg         ___ratelimit(&(EXT4_SB(sb)->s_msg_ratelimit_state)           if (!rs->interval)  // do nothing if interval is 0             return 1;           raw_spin_trylock_irqsave(&rs->lock, flags)             raw_spin_trylock(lock)               _raw_spin_trylock                 __raw_spin_trylock                   spin_acquire(&lock->dep_map, 0, 1, _RET_IP_)                     lock_acquire                       __lock_acquire                         register_lock_class                           assign_lock_key                             dump_stack();   ratelimit_state_init(&sbi->s_msg_ratelimit_state, 5 * HZ, 10);     raw_spin_lock_init(&rs->lock);     // init rs->lock here  and get the following dump_stack:  ========================================================= INFO: trying to register non-static key.

Since this relies on hrtimer_cancel as well, it is prone to the same deadlock situation as the previous patch.  It would be sufficient to use hrtimer_try_to_cancel to fix this problem, as the timer cannot be enqueued after async_cancel_and_free. Once async_cancel_and_free has been done, the timer must be reinitialized before it can be armed again. The callback running in parallel trying to arm the timer will fail, and freeing bpf_hrtimer without waiting is sufficient (given kfree_rcu), and bpf_timer_cb will return HRTIMER_NORESTART, preventing the timer from being rearmed again.  However, there exists a UAF scenario where the callback arms the timer before entering this function, such that if cancellation fails (due to timer callback invoking this routine, or the target timer callback running concurrently). In such a case, if the timer expiration is significantly far in the future, the RCU grace period expiration happening before it will free the bpf_hrtimer state and along with it the struct hrtimer, that is enqueued.  Hence, it is clear cancellation needs to occur after async_cancel_and_free, and yet it cannot be done inline due to deadlock issues. We thus modify bpf_timer_cancel_and_free to defer work to the global workqueue, adding a work_struct alongside rcu_head (both used at _different_ points of time, so can share space).

[CAUSE] Inside scrub_submit_extent_sector_read() every time we allocated a new bbio we immediately called btrfs_map_block() to make sure there was some RST range covering the scrub target.  But if btrfs_map_block() fails, we immediately call endio for the bbio, while the bbio is newly allocated, it's completely empty.  Then inside scrub_read_endio(), we go through the bvecs to find the sector number (as bi_sector is no longer reliable if the bio is submitted to lower layers).  And since the bio is empty, such bvecs iteration would not find any sector matching the sector, and return sector_nr == stripe->nr_sectors, triggering the ASSERT().  [FIX] Instead of calling btrfs_map_block() after allocating a new bbio, call btrfs_map_block() first.  Since our only objective of calling btrfs_map_block() is only to update stripe_len, there is really no need to do that after btrfs_alloc_bio().  This new timing would avoid the problem of handling empty bbio completely, and in fact fixes a possible race window for the old code, where if the submission thread is the only owner of the pending_io, the scrub would never finish (since we didn't decrease the pending_io counter).

Add an atomic_t count named 'cancelling' in bpf_hrtimer. This keeps track of all in-flight cancellation requests for a given BPF timer. Whenever cancelling a BPF timer, we must check if we have outstanding cancellation requests, and if so, we must fail the operation with an error (-EDEADLK) since cancellation is synchronous and waits for the callback to finish executing. This implies that we can enter a deadlock situation involving two or more timer callbacks executing in parallel and attempting to cancel one another.  Note that we avoid incrementing the cancelling counter for the target timer (the one being cancelled) if bpf_timer_cancel is not invoked from a callback, to avoid spurious errors. The whole point of detecting cur->cancelling and returning -EDEADLK is to not enter a busy wait loop (which may or may not lead to a lockup). This does not apply in case the caller is in a non-callback context, the other side can continue to cancel as it sees fit without running into errors.  Background on prior attempts:  Earlier versions of this patch used a bool 'cancelling' bit and used the following pattern under timer->lock to publish cancellation status.  lock(t->lock); t->cancelling = true; mb(); if (cur->cancelling) \treturn -EDEADLK; unlock(t->lock); hrtimer_cancel(t->timer); t->cancelling = false;  The store outside the critical section could overwrite a parallel requests t->cancelling assignment to true, to ensure the parallely executing callback observes its cancellation status.  It would be necessary to clear this cancelling bit once hrtimer_cancel is done, but lack of serialization introduced races. Another option was explored where bpf_timer_start would clear the bit when (re)starting the timer under timer->lock. This would ensure serialized access to the cancelling bit, but may allow it to be cleared before in-flight hrtimer_cancel has finished executing, such that lockups can occur again.

In other words, the Tx buffer data on channel B is corrupted with data from channel A.  The problem appeared since commit 4409df5866b7 (\"serial: sc16is7xx: change EFR lock to operate on each channels\"), which changed the EFR locking to operate on each channel instead of chip-wise.  This commit has introduced a regression, because the EFR lock is used not only to protect the EFR registers access, but also, in a very obscure and undocumented way, to protect access to the data buffer, which is shared by the Tx and Rx handlers, but also by each channel of the IC.  Fix this regression first by switching to kfifo_out_linear_ptr() in sc16is7xx_handle_tx() to eliminate the need for a shared Rx/Tx buffer.

There is plenty of code between those calls and there is no need to create a large critical section that covers all of them, same as there is no need to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() with rtnl_lock().  Add xdp_state_lock mutex to protect ice_vsi_rebuild() and ice_xdp().  Leaving unprotected sections in between would result in two states that have to be considered: 1. when the VSI is closed, but not yet rebuild 2. when VSI is already rebuild, but not yet open  The latter case is actually already handled through !netif_running() case, we just need to adjust flag checking a little. The former one is not as trivial, because between ice_vsi_close() and ice_vsi_rebuild(), a lot of hardware interaction happens, this can make adding/deleting rings exit with an error.

The pmd_trans_huge() code in mfill_atomic() is wrong in three different ways depending on kernel version:  1. The pmd_trans_huge() check is racy and can lead to a BUG_ON() (if you hit    the right two race windows) - I've tested this in a kernel build with    some extra mdelay() calls. See the commit message for a description    of the race scenario.    On older kernels (before 6.5), I think the same bug can even    theoretically lead to accessing transhuge page contents as a page table    if you hit the right 5 narrow race windows (I haven't tested this case). 2. As pointed out by Qi Zheng, pmd_trans_huge() is not sufficient for    detecting PMDs that don't point to page tables.    On older kernels (before 6.5), you'd just have to win a single fairly    wide race to hit this.    I've tested this on 6.1 stable by racing migration (with a mdelay()    patched into try_to_migrate()) against UFFDIO_ZEROPAGE - on my x86    VM, that causes a kernel oops in ptlock_ptr(). 3. On newer kernels (>=6.5), for shmem mappings, khugepaged is allowed    to yank page tables out from under us (though I haven't tested that),    so I think the BUG_ON() checks in mfill_atomic() are just wrong.  I decided to write two separate fixes for these (one fix for bugs 1+2, one fix for bug 3), so that the first fix can be backported to kernels affected by bugs 1+2.   This patch (of 2):  This fixes two issues.  I discovered that the following race can occur:    mfill_atomic                other thread   ============                ============                               <zap PMD>   pmdp_get_lockless() [reads none pmd]   <bail if trans_huge>   <if none:>                               <pagefault creates transhuge zeropage>     __pte_alloc [no-op]                               <zap PMD>   <bail if pmd_trans_huge(*dst_pmd)>   BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd))  I have experimentally verified this in a kernel with extra mdelay() calls; the BUG_ON(pmd_none(*dst_pmd)) triggers.  On kernels newer than commit 0d940a9b270b (\"mm/pgtable: allow pte_offset_map[_lock]() to fail\"), this can't lead to anything worse than a BUG_ON(), since the page table access helpers are actually designed to deal with page tables concurrently disappearing; but on older kernels (<=6.4), I think we could probably theoretically race past the two BUG_ON() checks and end up treating a hugepage as a page table.  The second issue is that, as Qi Zheng pointed out, there are other types of huge PMDs that pmd_trans_huge() can't catch: devmap PMDs and swap PMDs (in particular, migration PMDs).  On <=6.4, this is worse than the first issue: If mfill_atomic() runs on a PMD that contains a migration entry (which just requires winning a single, fairly wide race), it will pass the PMD to pte_offset_map_lock(), which assumes that the PMD points to a page table.  Breakage follows: First, the kernel tries to take the PTE lock (which will crash or maybe worse if there is no \"struct page\" for the address bits in the migration entry PMD - I think at least on X86 there usually is no corresponding \"struct page\" thanks to the PTE inversion mitigation, amd64 looks different).  If that didn't crash, the kernel would next try to write a PTE into what it wrongly thinks is a page table.  As part of fixing these issues, get rid of the check for pmd_trans_huge() before __pte_alloc() - that's redundant, we're going to have to check for that after the __pte_alloc() anyway.  Backport note: pmdp_get_lockless() is pmd_read_atomic() in older kernels.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-46787","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05196,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012124999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none

The issue is that for MBX_TIMEOUT cases, when firmware returns SFP information at a later time, that same mailbox memory region references previously freed memory in its cmpl routine.  Fix by adding checks for the MBX_TIMEOUT return code.  During mailbox resource cleanup, check the mbox flag to make sure that the wait did not timeout.

Since the waits happen only at lower interrupt levels the risk of taking too long at higher IRQ and causing a system watchdog timeout are minimal.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-46870","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.02997,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.008730000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-46870"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-47141","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47141","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  pinmux: Use sequential access to access desc->pinmux data  When two client of the same gpio call pinctrl_select_state() for the same functionality, we are seeing NULL pointer issue while accessing desc->mux_owner.

After looking into the crafted fuzzed image, I found it's formed with several overlapped big pclusters as below:   Ext:   logical offset   |  length :     physical offset    |  length    0:        0..   16384 |   16384 :     151552..    167936 |   16384    1:    16384..   32768 |   16384 :     155648..    172032 |   16384    2:    32768..   49152 |   16384 :  537223168.. 537239552 |   16384 ...  Here, extent 0/1 are physically overlapped although it's entirely _impossible_ for normal filesystem images generated by mkfs.  First, managed folios containing compressed data will be marked as up-to-date and then unlocked immediately (unlike in-place folios) when compressed I/Os are complete.  If physical blocks are not submitted in the incremental order, there should be separate BIOs to avoid dependency issues.  However, the current code mis-arranges z_erofs_fill_bio_vec() and BIO submission which causes unexpected BIO waits.  Second, managed folios will be connected to their own pclusters for efficient inter-queries.  However, this is somewhat hard to implement easily if overlapped big pclusters exist.

In an upcoming selftest, the attach target for entry_freplace of tailcall_freplace.c is subprog_tc of tc_bpf2bpf.c, while the tail call in entry_freplace leads to entry_tc. This results in an infinite loop:  entry_tc -> subprog_tc -> entry_freplace --tailcall-> entry_tc.  The problem arises because the tail_call_cnt in entry_freplace resets to zero each time entry_freplace is executed, causing the tail call mechanism to never terminate, eventually leading to a kernel panic.  To fix this issue, the solution is twofold:  1. Prevent updating a program extended by an freplace program to a    prog_array map. 2. Prevent extending a program that is already part of a prog_array map    with an freplace program.  This ensures that:  * If a program or its subprogram has been extended by an freplace program,   it can no longer be updated to a prog_array map. * If a program has been added to a prog_array map, neither it nor its   subprograms can be extended by an freplace program.  Moreover, an extension program should not be tailcalled. As such, return -EINVAL if the program has a type of BPF_PROG_TYPE_EXT when adding it to a prog_array map.  Additionally, fix a minor code style issue by replacing eight spaces with a tab for proper formatting.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-47794","epss":0.00028,"percentile":0.06067,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.013999999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-47794"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-47809","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-47809","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference  This patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function is called from request_lock() as lkb->lkb_resource is not assigned yet, only after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb().

When the session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel refcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is set in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented by l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where session->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been bumped.  Moving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but l2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses session->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to l2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.  If l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for l2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a session which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set.

One is specific to lan9303 and the other just happens to reproduce there.  The first problem is that lan9303 is unique among DSA drivers in that it calls dev_get_drvdata() at \"arbitrary runtime\" (not probe, not shutdown, not remove):  phy_state_machine() -> ...    -> dsa_user_phy_read()       -> ds->ops->phy_read()          -> lan9303_phy_read()             -> chip->ops->phy_read()                -> lan9303_mdio_phy_read()                   -> dev_get_drvdata()  But we never stop the phy_state_machine(), so it may continue to run after dsa_switch_shutdown(). Our common pattern in all DSA drivers is to set drvdata to NULL to suppress the remove() method that may come afterwards. But in this case it will result in an NPD.  The second problem is that the way in which we set dp->conduit->dsa_ptr = NULL; is concurrent with receive packet processing. dsa_switch_rcv() checks once whether dev->dsa_ptr is NULL, but afterwards, rather than continuing to use that non-NULL value, dev->dsa_ptr is dereferenced again and again without NULL checks: dsa_conduit_find_user() and many other places. In between dereferences, there is no locking to ensure that what was valid once continues to be valid.  Both problems have the common aspect that closing the conduit interface solves them.  In the first case, dev_close(conduit) triggers the NETDEV_GOING_DOWN event in dsa_user_netdevice_event() which closes user ports as well. dsa_port_disable_rt() calls phylink_stop(), which synchronously stops the phylink state machine, and ds->ops->phy_read() will thus no longer call into the driver after this point.  In the second case, dev_close(conduit) should do this, as per Documentation/networking/driver.rst:  | Quiescence | ---------- | | After the ndo_stop routine has been called, the hardware must | not receive or transmit any data.  All in flight packets must | be aborted. If necessary, poll or wait for completion of | any reset commands.  So it should be sufficient to ensure that later, when we zeroize conduit->dsa_ptr, there will be no concurrent dsa_switch_rcv() call on this conduit.  The addition of the netif_device_detach() function is to ensure that ioctls, rtnetlinks and ethtool requests on the user ports no longer propagate down to the driver - we're no longer prepared to handle them.  The race condition actually did not exist when commit 0650bf52b31f (\"net: dsa: be compatible with masters which unregister on shutdown\") first introduced dsa_switch_shutdown(). It was created later, when we stopped unregistering the user interfaces from a bad spot, and we just replaced that sequence with a racy zeroization of conduit->dsa_ptr (one which doesn't ensure that the interfaces aren't up).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-49998","epss":0.0003,"percentile":0.06769,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.014549999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-49998"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-50009","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-50009","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  cpufreq: amd-pstate: add check for cpufreq_cpu_get's return value  cpufreq_cpu_get may return NULL.

Those endpoints share a common switch-decoder in the topology (3.0). At teardown, 2), decoder14.0 is the first to be removed and hits the \"out of order reset case\" in the switch decoder. The effect though is that region3 cleanup is aborted leaving it in-tact and referencing decoder14.0. At 3) the second attempt to teardown region3 trips over the stale decoder14.0 object which has long since been deleted.  The fix here is to recognize that the CXL specification places no mandate on in-order shutdown of switch-decoders, the driver enforces in-order allocation, and hardware enforces in-order commit. So, rather than fail and leave objects dangling, always remove them.  In support of making cxl_region_decode_reset() always succeed, cxl_region_invalidate_memregion() failures are turned into warnings. Crashing the kernel is ok there since system integrity is at risk if caches cannot be managed around physical address mutation events like CXL region destruction.  A new device_for_each_child_reverse_from() is added to cleanup port->commit_end after all dependent decoders have been disabled. In other words if decoders are allocated 0->1->2 and disabled 1->2->0 then port->commit_end only decrements from 2 after 2 has been disabled, and it decrements all the way to zero since 1 was disabled previously.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-50226","epss":0.00038,"percentile":0.10712,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.029070000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none

the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/thp: fix deferred split unqueue naming and locking  Recent changes are putting more pressure on THP deferred split queues: under load revealing long-standing races, causing list_del corruptions, \"Bad page state\"s and worse (I keep BUGs in both of those, so usually don't get to see how badly they end up without).  The relevant recent changes being 6.8's mTHP, 6.10's mTHP swapout, and 6.12's mTHP swapin, improved swap allocation, and underused THP splitting.  Before fixing locking: rename misleading folio_undo_large_rmappable(), which does not undo large_rmappable, to folio_unqueue_deferred_split(), which is what it does.  But that and its out-of-line __callee are mm internals of very limited usability: add comment and WARN_ON_ONCEs to check usage; and return a bool to say if a deferred split was unqueued, which can then be used in WARN_ON_ONCEs around safety checks (sparing callers the arcane conditionals in __folio_unqueue_deferred_split()).  Just omit the folio_unqueue_deferred_split() from free_unref_folios(), all of whose callers now call it beforehand (and if any forget then bad_page() will tell) - except for its caller put_pages_list(), which itself no longer has any callers (and will be deleted separately).  Swapout: mem_cgroup_swapout() has been resetting folio->memcg_data 0 without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from deferred split list; which is unfortunate, since the split_queue_lock depends on the memcg (when memcg is enabled); so swapout has been unqueueing such THPs later, when freeing the folio, using the pgdat's lock instead: potentially corrupting the memcg's list.  __remove_mapping() has frozen refcount to 0 here, so no problem with calling folio_unqueue_deferred_split() before resetting memcg_data.  That goes back to 5.4 commit 87eaceb3faa5 (\"mm: thp: make deferred split shrinker memcg aware\"): which included a check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue, but no check on deferred queue before adding THP to swapcache.  That worked fine with the usual sequence of events in reclaim (though there were a couple of rare ways in which a THP on deferred queue could have been swapped out), but 6.12 commit dafff3f4c850 (\"mm: split underused THPs\") avoids splitting underused THPs in reclaim, which makes swapcache THPs on deferred queue commonplace.  Keep the check on swapcache before adding to deferred queue?  Yes: it is no longer essential, but preserves the existing behaviour, and is likely to be a worthwhile optimization (vmstat showed much more traffic on the queue under swapping load if the check was removed); update its comment.  Memcg-v1 move (deprecated): mem_cgroup_move_account() has been changing folio->memcg_data without checking and unqueueing a THP folio from the deferred list, sometimes corrupting \"from\" memcg's list, like swapout.  Refcount is non-zero here, so folio_unqueue_deferred_split() can only be used in a WARN_ON_ONCE to validate the fix, which must be done earlier: mem_cgroup_move_charge_pte_range() first try to split the THP (splitting of course unqueues), or skip it if that fails.  Not ideal, but moving charge has been requested, and khugepaged should repair the THP later: nobody wants new custom unqueueing code just for this deprecated case.  The 87eaceb3faa5 commit did have the code to move from one deferred list to another (but was not conscious of its unsafety while refcount non-0); but that was removed by 5.6 commit fac0516b5534 (\"mm: thp: don't need care deferred split queue in memcg charge move path\"), which argued that the existence of a PMD mapping guarantees that the THP cannot be on a deferred list.  As above, false in rare cases, and now commonly false.  Backport to 6.11 should be straightforward.  Earlier backports must take care that other _deferred_list fixes and dependencies are included.  There is not a strong case for backports, but they can fix cornercases.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-53079","epss":0.00017,"percentile":0.0258,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.008925},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-53079"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-53085","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-53085","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  tpm: Lock TPM chip in tpm_pm_suspend() first  Setting TPM_CHIP_FLAG_SUSPENDED in the end of tpm_pm_suspend() can be racy according, as this leaves window for tpm_hwrng_read() to be called while the operation is in progress.

Recently, we got a customer report that CIFS triggers oops while reconnecting to a server.  [0]  The workload runs on Kubernetes, and some pods mount CIFS servers in non-root network namespaces.  The problem rarely happened, but it was always while the pod was dying.  The root cause is wrong reference counting for network namespace.  CIFS uses kernel sockets, which do not hold refcnt of the netns that the socket belongs to.  That means CIFS must ensure the socket is always freed before its netns; otherwise, use-after-free happens.  The repro steps are roughly:    1. mount CIFS in a non-root netns   2. drop packets from the netns   3. destroy the netns   4. unmount CIFS  We can reproduce the issue quickly with the script [1] below and see the splat [2] if CONFIG_NET_NS_REFCNT_TRACKER is enabled.  When the socket is TCP, it is hard to guarantee the netns lifetime without holding refcnt due to async timers.  Let's hold netns refcnt for each socket as done for SMC in commit 9744d2bf1976 (\"smc: Fix use-after-free in tcp_write_timer_handler().\").  Note that we need to move put_net() from cifs_put_tcp_session() to clean_demultiplex_info(); otherwise, __sock_create() still could touch a freed netns while cifsd tries to reconnect from cifs_demultiplex_thread().  Also, maybe_get_net() cannot be put just before __sock_create() because the code is not under RCU and there is a small chance that the same address happened to be reallocated to another netns.

nfs -o proto=tcp,vers=4.1 \\ \t11.11.0.254:/mnt/nfsshare /mnt/nfs/netns_1  ip netns del netns_1  The reason here is that the tcp socket in netns_1 (nfs side) has been shutdown and closed (done in xs_destroy), but the FIN message (with ack) is discarded, and the nfsd side keeps sending retransmission messages. As a result, when the tcp sock in netns_1 processes the received message, it sends the message (FIN message) in the sending queue, and the tcp timer is re-established. When the network namespace is deleted, the net structure accessed by tcp's timer handler function causes problems.  To fix this problem, let's hold netns refcnt for the tcp kernel socket as done in other modules. This is an ugly hack which can easily be backported to earlier kernels. A proper fix which cleans up the interfaces will follow, but may not be so easy to backport.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-53168","epss":0.00026,"percentile":0.05513,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.019889999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-53168"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-53176","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-53176","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: During unmount, ensure all cached dir instances drop their dentry  The unmount process (cifs_kill_sb() calling close_all_cached_dirs()) can race with various cached directory operations, which ultimately results in dentries not being dropped and these kernel BUGs:  BUG: Dentry ffff88814f37e358{i=1000000000080,n=/}  still in use (2) [unmount of cifs cifs] VFS: Busy inodes after unmount of cifs (cifs) ------------[ cut here ]------------ kernel BUG at fs/super.c:661!  This happens when a cfid is in the process of being cleaned up when, and has been removed from the cfids->entries list, including:  - Receiving a lease break from the server - Server reconnection triggers invalidate_all_cached_dirs(), which   removes all the cfids from the list - The laundromat thread decides to expire an old cfid.  To solve these problems, dropping the dentry is done in queued work done in a newly-added cfid_put_wq workqueue, and close_all_cached_dirs() flushes that workqueue after it drops all the dentries of which it's aware. This is a global workqueue (rather than scoped to a mount), but the queued work is minimal.  The final cleanup work for cleaning up a cfid is performed via work queued in the serverclose_wq workqueue; this is done separate from dropping the dentries so that close_all_cached_dirs() doesn't block on any server operations.  Both of these queued works expect to invoked with a cfid reference and a tcon reference to avoid those objects from being freed while the work is ongoing.

As for now, the maximal read size for kvec iter is only limited by fc->max_read. For virtio-fs, max_read is UINT_MAX, so fuse_direct_io() doesn't split the 10MB buffer. It saves the address and the size of the 10MB-sized buffer in out_args[0] of a fuse request and passes the fuse request to virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock().  4) virtio_fs_wake_pending_and_unlock() uses virtio_fs_enqueue_req() to queue the request. Because virtiofs need DMA-able address, so virtio_fs_enqueue_req() uses kmalloc() to allocate a bounce buffer for all fuse args, copies these args into the bounce buffer and passed the physical address of the bounce buffer to virtiofsd. The total length of these fuse args for the passed fuse request is about 10MB, so copy_args_to_argbuf() invokes kmalloc() with a 10MB size parameter and it triggers the warning in __alloc_pages():  \tif (WARN_ON_ONCE_GFP(order > MAX_PAGE_ORDER, gfp)) \t\treturn NULL;  5) virtio_fs_enqueue_req() will retry the memory allocation in a kworker, but it won't help, because kmalloc() will always return NULL due to the abnormal size and finit_module() will hang forever.  A feasible solution is to limit the value of max_read for virtio-fs, so the length passed to kmalloc() will be limited. However it will affect the maximal read size for normal read. And for virtio-fs write initiated from kernel, it has the similar problem but now there is no way to limit fc->max_write in kernel.  So instead of limiting both the values of max_read and max_write in kernel, introducing use_pages_for_kvec_io in fuse_conn and setting it as true in virtiofs. When use_pages_for_kvec_io is enabled, fuse will use pages instead of pointer to pass the KVEC_IO data.  After switching to pages for KVEC_IO data, these pages will be used for DMA through virtio-fs. If these pages are backed by vmalloc(), {flush|invalidate}_kernel_vmap_range() are necessary to flush or invalidate the cache before the DMA operation. So add two new fields in fuse_args_pages to record the base address of vmalloc area and the condition indicating whether invalidation is needed. Perform the flush in fuse_get_user_pages() for write operations and the invalidation in fuse_release_user_pages() for read operations.  It may seem necessary to introduce another fie ---truncated---","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-53219","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11496,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-53219"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-53221","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-53221","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  f2fs: fix null-ptr-deref in f2fs_submit_page_bio()  There's issue as follows when concurrently installing the f2fs.ko module and mounting the f2fs file system: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in range [0x0000000000000020-0x0000000000000027] RIP: 0010:__bio_alloc+0x2fb/0x6c0 [f2fs] Call Trace:  <TASK>  f2fs_submit_page_bio+0x126/0x8b0 [f2fs]  __get_meta_page+0x1d4/0x920 [f2fs]  get_checkpoint_version.constprop.0+0x2b/0x3c0 [f2fs]  validate_checkpoint+0xac/0x290 [f2fs]  f2fs_get_valid_checkpoint+0x207/0x950 [f2fs]  f2fs_fill_super+0x1007/0x39b0 [f2fs]  mount_bdev+0x183/0x250  legacy_get_tree+0xf4/0x1e0  vfs_get_tree+0x88/0x340  do_new_mount+0x283/0x5e0  path_mount+0x2b2/0x15b0  __x64_sys_mount+0x1fe/0x270  do_syscall_64+0x5f/0x170  entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x76/0x7e  Above issue happens as the biset of the f2fs file system is not initialized before register \"f2fs_fs_type\".

When an object belonging to the slab got freed later, the remove_full() function is called.

However, bpf_map_alloc_id() invokes idr_alloc_cyclic() after acquiring map_idr_lock, it will trigger a similar lockdep warning because the slab's lock (s->cpu_slab->lock) is still a spinlock.  Instead of changing map_idr_lock's type, fix the issue by invoking htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket(). However, only deferring the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() is not enough, because the old map pointers in htab of maps can not be saved during batched deletion. Therefore, also defer the invocation of free_htab_elem(), so these to-be-freed elements could be linked together similar to lru map.  There are four callers for ->map_fd_put_ptr:  (1) alloc_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) It invokes ->map_fd_put_ptr() under a raw_spinlock_t. The invocation of htab_put_fd_value() can not simply move after htab_unlock_bucket(), because the old element has already been stashed in htab->extra_elems. It may be reused immediately after htab_unlock_bucket() and the invocation of htab_put_fd_value() after htab_unlock_bucket() may release the newly-added element incorrectly. Therefore, saving the map pointer of the old element for htab of maps before unlocking the bucket and releasing the map_ptr after unlock. Beside the map pointer in the old element, should do the same thing for the special fields in the old element as well.  (2) free_htab_elem() (through htab_put_fd_value()) Its caller includes __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem(), htab_map_delete_elem() and __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch().  For htab_map_delete_elem(), simply invoke free_htab_elem() after htab_unlock_bucket(). For __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_batch(), just like lru map, linking the to-be-freed element into node_to_free list and invoking free_htab_elem() for these element after unlock. It is safe to reuse batch_flink as the link for node_to_free, because these elements have been removed from the hash llist.  Because htab of maps doesn't support lookup_and_delete operation, __htab_map_lookup_and_delete_elem() doesn't have the problem, so kept it as ---truncated---","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56592","epss":0.0004,"percentile":0.11496,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-56592"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-56611","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56611","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  mm/mempolicy: fix migrate_to_node() assuming there is at least one VMA in a MM  We currently assume that there is at least one VMA in a MM, which isn't true.

Note that the shape of this code changed a lot in commit 5e72b2b41a21 (\"udmabuf: convert udmabuf driver to use folios\"); but the memory leak seems to have existed since the introduction of udmabuf.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56712","epss":0.00037,"percentile":0.10324,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.019425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-56712"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-56719","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56719","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net: stmmac: fix TSO DMA API usage causing oops  Commit 66600fac7a98 (\"net: stmmac: TSO: Fix unbalanced DMA map/unmap for non-paged SKB data\") moved the assignment of tx_skbuff_dma[]'s members to be later in stmmac_tso_xmit().

As such, it's not (generally) correct to put link's program early before waiting for RCU GPs to go through. More eager bpf_prog_put() that we currently do is mostly correct due to BPF program's release code doing similar RCU GP waiting, but as will be shown in the following patches, BPF program can be non-sleepable (and, thus, reliant on only \"classic\" RCU GP), while BPF link's attach hook can have sleepable semantics and needs to be protected by RCU Tasks Trace, and for such cases BPF link has to go through RCU Tasks Trace + \"classic\" RCU GPs before being deallocated. And so, if we put BPF program early, we might free BPF program before we free BPF link, leading to use-after-free situation.  So, this patch defers bpf_prog_put() until we are ready to perform bpf_link's deallocation. At worst, this delays BPF program freeing by one extra RCU GP, but that seems completely acceptable. Alternatively, we'd need more elaborate ways to determine BPF hook, BPF link, and BPF program lifetimes, and how they relate to each other, which seems like an unnecessary complication.  Note, for most BPF links we still will perform eager bpf_prog_put() and link dealloc, so for those BPF links there are no observable changes whatsoever. Only BPF links that use deferred dealloc might notice slightly delayed freeing of BPF programs.  Also, to reduce code and logic duplication, extract program put + link dealloc logic into bpf_link_dealloc() helper.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-56786","epss":0.00023,"percentile":0.04406,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012075},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-56786"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-57795","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57795","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/rxe: Remove the direct link to net_device  The similar patch in siw is in the link: https://git.kernel.org/rdma/rdma/c/16b87037b48889  This problem also occurred in RXE.

It targets the same problem as the following downstream commit:    https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/commit/4e92355e1f79d225ea842511fcfd42b343b32995  Unlike the downstream commit, this patch also resets the connected PCIe device if possible. Without this reset, certain drivers, such as ath10k or iwlwifi, will crash on resume. The device reset is also done by the driver on other i.MX platforms, making this patch consistent with existing practices.  Upon resuming, the kernel will hang and display an error. Here's an example of the error encountered with the ath10k driver:    ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: Unable to change power state from D3hot to D0, device inaccessible   Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0x0106f944  Without this patch, suspend/resume will fail on i.MX6QDL devices if a PCIe device is connected.

This is correct when flushing, but when called from the cancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is either already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore cancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the helper know of the calling context.

There are a few other users of exportfs_encode_{fh,fid}() that currently have a WARN_ON() assertion when ->encode_fh() fails. Relax those assertions because they are wrong.  The second linked bug report states commit 16aac5ad1fa9 (\"ovl: support encoding non-decodable file handles\") in v6.6 as the regressing commit, but this is not accurate.  The aforementioned commit only increases the chances of the assertion and allows triggering the assertion with the reproducer using overlayfs, inotify and drop_caches.  Triggering this assertion was always possible with other filesystems and other reasons of ->encode_fh() failures and more particularly, it was also possible with the exact same reproducer using overlayfs that is mounted with options index=on,nfs_export=on also on kernels < v6.6.

And the struct page's va can be calculated with an offset: (vmemmap + (pfn)).  However, when initializing struct pages, kernel actually starts from the first page from the same section that phys_ram_base belongs to. If the first page's physical address is not (phys_ram_base >> PAGE_SHIFT), then we get an va below VMEMMAP_START when calculating va for it's struct page.  For example, if phys_ram_base starts from 0x82000000 with pfn 0x82000, the first page in the same section is actually pfn 0x80000. During init_unavailable_range(), we will initialize struct page for pfn 0x80000 with virtual address ((struct page *)VMEMMAP_START - 0x2000), which is below VMEMMAP_START as well as PCI_IO_END.

This mechanism typically returns values that increase monotonically over time. Eventually, though, the newly allocated offset value wraps back to a low number (say, 2) which is smaller than other already- allocated offset values.  Yu Kuai <yukuai3@huawei.com> reports that, after commit 64a7ce76fb90 (\"libfs: fix infinite directory reads for offset dir\"), if a directory's offset allocator wraps, existing entries are no longer visible via readdir/getdents because offset_readdir() stops listing entries once an entry's offset is larger than octx->next_offset. These entries vanish persistently -- they can be looked up, but will never again appear in readdir(3) output.  The reason for this is that the commit treats directory offsets as monotonically increasing integer values rather than opaque cookies, and introduces this comparison:  \tif (dentry2offset(dentry) >= last_index) {  On 64-bit platforms, the directory offset value upper bound is 2^63 - 1. Directory offsets will monotonically increase for millions of years without wrapping.  On 32-bit platforms, however, LONG_MAX is 2^31 - 1. The allocator can wrap after only a few weeks (at worst).

Secondary hash chains were introduced by commit 30fff9231fad (\"udp: bind() optimisation\") and, as a result, a rehash operation became needed to make a bound socket reachable again after a connect().  This operation was introduced by commit 719f835853a9 (\"udp: add rehash on connect()\") which isn't however a complete fix: the socket will be found once the rehashing completes, but not while it's pending.  This is noticeable with a socat(1) server in UDP4-LISTEN mode, and a client sending datagrams to it. After the server receives the first datagram (cf. _xioopen_ipdgram_listen()), it issues a connect() to the address of the sender, in order to set up a directed flow.  Now, if the client, running on a different CPU thread, happens to send a (subsequent) datagram while the server's socket changes its address, but is not rehashed yet, this will result in a failed lookup and a port unreachable error delivered to the client, as apparent from the following reproducer:    LEN=$(($(cat /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_default) / 4))   dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=${LEN} of=tmp.in    while :; do   \ttaskset -c 1 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &   \tsleep 0.1 || sleep 1   \ttaskset -c 2 socat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:localhost:1337,shut-null   \twait   done  where the client will eventually get ECONNREFUSED on a write() (typically the second or third one of a given iteration):    2024/11/13 21:28:23 socat[46901] E write(6, 0x556db2e3c000, 8192): Connection refused  This issue was first observed as a seldom failure in Podman's tests checking UDP functionality while using pasta(1) to connect the container's network namespace, which leads us to a reproducer with the lookup error resulting in an ICMP packet on a tap device:    LOCAL_ADDR=\"$(ip -j -4 addr show|jq -rM '.[] | .addr_info[0] | select(.scope == \"global\").local')\"    while :; do   \t./pasta --config-net -p pasta.pcap -u 1337 socat UDP4-LISTEN:1337,null-eof OPEN:tmp.out,create,trunc &   \tsleep 0.2 || sleep 1   \tsocat OPEN:tmp.in UDP4:${LOCAL_ADDR}:1337,shut-null   \twait   \tcmp tmp.in tmp.out   done  Once this fails:    tmp.in tmp.out differ: char 8193, line 29  we can finally have a look at what's going on:    $ tshark -r pasta.pcap       1   0.000000           :: ? ff02::16     ICMPv6 110 Multicast Listener Report Message v2       2   0.168690 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192       3   0.168767 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192       4   0.168806 88.198.0.161 ? 88.198.0.164 UDP 8234 60260 ? 1337 Len=8192       5   0.168827 c6:47:05:8d:dc:04 ?

E.g. we have the following dirtied range (4K blocksize 4K page size):      0                 16K                  32K     |//////////////////////////////////////|     |  Pre-allocated  |  And the range [0, 16K) has a preallocated extent.  - Enter run_delalloc_nocow() for range [0, 16K)   Which found range [0, 16K) is preallocated, can do the proper NOCOW   write.  - Enter fallback_to_fow() for range [16K, 32K)   Since the range [16K, 32K) is not backed by preallocated extent, we   have to go COW.  - cow_file_range() failed for range [16K, 32K)   So cow_file_range() will do the clean up by clearing folio dirty,   unlock the folios.    Now the folios in range [16K, 32K) is unlocked.  - Enter extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() from run_delalloc_nocow()   Which is called with PAGE_START_WRITEBACK to start page writeback.   But folios can only be marked writeback when it's properly locked,   thus this triggered the VM_BUG_ON_FOLIO().

Although the -ENOSPC is already a bug related to our space reservation code, let's just focus on the error handling.  For example, we have the following dirty range [0, 64K) of an inode, with 4K sector size and 4K page size:     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |///////////////////////////////////////|    |#######################################|  Where |///| means page are still dirty, and |###| means the extent io tree has EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.  - Enter extent_writepage() for page 0  - Enter btrfs_run_delalloc_range() for range [0, 64K)  - Enter cow_file_range() for range [0, 64K)  - Function btrfs_reserve_extent() only reserved one 16K extent   So we created extent map and ordered extent for range [0, 16K)     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |////////|//////////////////////////////|    |<- OE ->|##############################|     And range [0, 16K) has its delalloc flag cleared.    But since we haven't yet submit any bio, involved 4 pages are still    dirty.  - Function btrfs_reserve_extent() returns with -ENOSPC   Now we have to run error cleanup, which will clear all   EXTENT_DELALLOC* flags and clear the dirty flags for the remaining   ranges:     0        16K        32K       48K       64K    |////////|                              |    |        |                              |    Note that range [0, 16K) still has its pages dirty.  - Some time later, writeback is triggered again for the range [0, 16K)   since the page range still has dirty flags.  - btrfs_run_delalloc_range() will do nothing because there is no   EXTENT_DELALLOC flag.  - extent_writepage_io() finds page 0 has no ordered flag   Which falls into the COW fixup path, triggering the BUG_ON().  Unfortunately this error handling bug dates back to the introduction of btrfs.  Thankfully with the abuse of COW fixup, at least it won't crash the kernel.  [FIX] Instead of immediately unlocking the extent and folios, we keep the extent and folios locked until either erroring out or the whole delalloc range finished.  When the whole delalloc range finished without error, we just unlock the whole range with PAGE_SET_ORDERED (and PAGE_UNLOCK for !keep_locked cases) ---truncated---","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-57976","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.05664,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0135},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-57976"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-57982","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-57982","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  xfrm: state: fix out-of-bounds read during lookup  lookup and resize can run in parallel.

This means that set_bar() can be called twice, without ever calling clear_bar() (as calling clear_bar() would clear the BAR's PCI address assigned by the host).  This can only be done if the new BAR size/flags does not differ from the existing BAR configuration. Add these missing checks.  If we allow set_bar() to set e.g. a new BAR size that differs from the existing BAR size, the new address translation range will be smaller than the BAR size already determined by the host, which would mean that a read past the new BAR size would pass the iATU untranslated, which could allow the host to read memory not belonging to the new struct pci_epf_bar.

That was too late. If function 0 is removed before sibling function, link->downstream would point to free'd memory after.  After above change, we freed the ASPM parent link state upon any function removal on the bus pertaining to a given link.  That is too early. If the link is to a PCIe switch with MFD on the upstream port, then removing functions other than 0 first would free a link which still remains parent_link to the remaining downstream ports.  The resulting GPFs are especially frequent during hot-unplug, because pciehp removes devices on the link bus in reverse order.

For example, consider the following program:      __attribute__((__noinline__))     long skb_pull_data(struct __sk_buff *sk, __u32 len)     {         return bpf_skb_pull_data(sk, len);     }      SEC(\"tc\")     int test_invalidate_checks(struct __sk_buff *sk)     {         int *p = (void *)(long)sk->data;         if ((void *)(p + 1) > (void *)(long)sk->data_end) return TCX_DROP;         skb_pull_data(sk, 0);         *p = 42;         return TCX_PASS;     }  After a call to bpf_skb_pull_data() the pointer 'p' can't be used safely. See function filter.c:bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data() for a list of such helpers.  At the moment verifier invalidates packet pointers when processing helper function calls, and does not traverse global sub-programs when processing calls to global sub-programs. This means that calls to helpers done from global sub-programs do not invalidate pointers in the caller state. E.g. the program above is unsafe, but is not rejected by verifier.  This commit fixes the omission by computing field bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data for each sub-program before main verification pass. changes_pkt_data should be set if: - subprogram calls helper for which bpf_helper_changes_pkt_data   returns true; - subprogram calls a global function,   for which bpf_subprog_info->changes_pkt_data should be set.  The verifier.c:check_cfg() pass is modified to compute this information. The commit relies on depth first instruction traversal done by check_cfg() and absence of recursive function calls: - check_cfg() would eventually visit every call to subprogram S in a   state when S is fully explored; - when S is fully explored:   - every direct helper call within S is explored     (and thus changes_pkt_data is set if needed);   - every call to subprogram S1 called by S was visited with S1 fully     explored (and thus S inherits changes_pkt_data from S1).  The downside of such approach is that dead code elimination is not taken into account: if a helper call inside global function is dead because of current configuration, verifier would conservatively assume that the call occurs for the purpose of the changes_pkt_data computation.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-58098","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.04803,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-58098"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-58100","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-58100","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  bpf: check changes_pkt_data property for extension programs  When processing calls to global sub-programs, verifier decides whether to invalidate all packet pointers in current state depending on the changes_pkt_data property of the global sub-program.

To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (\"cpuset: break kernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()\") added 'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could lead to this warning.  After the commit 2125c0034c5d (\"cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug processing synchronous\"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to wait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset operations are no longer possible.

Then it triggered a scrub, but since scrub relies on extent tree to find where the data/metadata extents are, scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() relies on an non-empty extent root.  But unfortunately scrub_find_fill_first_stripe() doesn't really expect an NULL pointer for extent root, it use extent_root to grab fs_info and triggered a NULL pointer dereference.  [FIX] Add an extra check for a valid extent root at the beginning of scrub_find_fill_first_stripe().  The new error path is introduced by 42437a6386ff (\"btrfs: introduce mount option rescue=ignorebadroots\"), but that's pretty old, and later commit b979547513ff (\"btrfs: scrub: introduce helper to find and fill sector info for a scrub_stripe\") changed how we do scrub.  So for kernels older than 6.6, the fix will need manual backport.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21658","epss":0.00029,"percentile":0.0646,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.015225},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21658"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21673","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21673","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix double free of TCP_Server_Info::hostname  When shutting down the server in cifs_put_tcp_session(), cifsd thread might be reconnecting to multiple DFS targets before it realizes it should exit the loop, so @server->hostname can't be freed as long as cifsd thread isn't done.

However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled, it is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.  If the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use, we run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx are freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e.  acomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).  The problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use crypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the crypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was retrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the CPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the crypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.  Use the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating and freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure that acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the compression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after acquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new CPU.  The initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug callback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is allocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU hotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by compression/decompression.  Previously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This would have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already holding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a deadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but Johannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug notifiers [2].  Alternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked: - Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in   handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in   zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the   CPU is onlined. - Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but   that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could   result in subtle performance issues.

Cover PTE, huge PMD and hugetlb paths.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21696","epss":0.00019,"percentile":0.03139,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.009975000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21696"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21714","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21714","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  RDMA/mlx5: Fix implicit ODP use after free  Prevent double queueing of implicit ODP mr destroy work by using __xa_cmpxchg() to make sure this is the only time we are destroying this specific mr.

During the __mlx5_ib_dereg_mr() flow, the following sequence of calls occurs:  mlx5_revoke_mr()  mlx5r_umr_revoke_mr()  mlx5r_umr_post_send_wait()  At this point, the lkey is freed from the hardware's perspective.  However, concurrently, mlx5_ib_invalidate_range() might be triggered by another task attempting to invalidate a range for the same freed lkey.  This task will:  - Acquire the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock.  - Call mlx5r_umr_update_xlt() on the UMR QP.  - Since the lkey has already been freed, this can lead to a CQE error,    causing the UMR QP to enter an error state [1].  To resolve this race condition, the umem_odp->umem_mutex lock is now also acquired as part of the mlx5_revoke_mr() scope.  Upon successful revoke, we set umem_odp->private which points to that MR to NULL, preventing any further invalidation attempts on its lkey.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when some FW command fails during disconnect.  Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this problem.

However, it will make the concurrent overwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when the map is full.  Therefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling of bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT: 1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value 2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to    cancel it again Considering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try to acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is running, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has downside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is delayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable (e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in locked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if necessary.  It is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the problem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the softirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced in v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra depends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.

When the system is suspended if the port is not power manageable by the platform and won't be used for wakeup via a PME this sets up the policy for these ports to go into D3hot.  This policy generally makes sense from an OSPM perspective but it leads to problems with wakeup from suspend on the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a specific old BIOS. This manifests as a system hang.  On the affected Device + BIOS combination, add a quirk for the root port of the problematic controller to ensure that these root ports are not put into D3hot at suspend.  This patch is based on    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20230708214457.1229-2-mario.limonciello@amd.com  but with the added condition both in the documentation and in the code to apply only to the TUXEDO Sirius 16 Gen 1 with a specific old BIOS and only the affected root ports.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21831","epss":0.0003,"percentile":0.06862,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.015},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21831"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21836","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21836","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  io_uring/kbuf: reallocate buf lists on upgrade  IORING_REGISTER_PBUF_RING can reuse an old struct io_buffer_list if it was created for legacy selected buffer and has been emptied.

When the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest, KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint only generates one VM-Exit.  For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest) and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.  But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done _inside_ the core run loop.  Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and clobber the guest's actual value.  The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6 being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the window where hardware DR6 is \"dirty\" extends all the way from L1 writing DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

During recovery, before transitioning the QP to the RESET state, the software must wait for all outstanding WRs to complete.  Failing to do so can cause the firmware to skip sending some flushed CQEs with errors and simply discard them upon the RESET, as per the IB specification.  This race condition can result in lost CQEs and tasks becoming stuck.  To resolve this, the patch sends a final WR which serves only as a barrier before moving the QP state to RESET.  Once a CQE is received for that final WR, it guarantees that no outstanding WRs remain, making it safe to transition the QP to RESET and subsequently back to RTS, restoring proper functionality.  Note: For the barrier WR, we simply reuse the failed and ready WR. Since the QP is in an error state, it will only receive IB_WC_WR_FLUSH_ERR. However, as it serves only as a barrier we don't care about its status.  [1] INFO: task rdma_resource_l:1922 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

Fix two bugs during folio migration if the folio is poisoned.   This patch (of 3):  Commit 6da6b1d4a7df (\"mm/hwpoison: convert TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON to TTU_HWPOISON\") introduce TTU_HWPOISON to replace TTU_IGNORE_HWPOISON in order to stop send SIGBUS signal when accessing an error page after a memory error on a clean folio.  However during page migration, anon folio must be set with TTU_HWPOISON during unmap_*().  For pagecache we need some policy just like the one in hwpoison_user_mappings to set this flag.  So move this policy from hwpoison_user_mappings to unmap_poisoned_folio to handle this warning properly.  Warning will be produced during unamp poison folio with the following log:    ------------[ cut here ]------------   WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 365 at mm/rmap.c:1847 try_to_unmap_one+0x8fc/0xd3c   Modules linked in:   CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 365 Comm: bash Tainted: G        W          6.13.0-rc1-00018-gacdb4bbda7ab #42   Tainted: [W]=WARN   Hardware name: QEMU QEMU Virtual Machine, BIOS 0.0.0 02/06/2015   pstate: 20400005 (nzCv daif +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)   pc : try_to_unmap_one+0x8fc/0xd3c   lr : try_to_unmap_one+0x3dc/0xd3c   Call trace:    try_to_unmap_one+0x8fc/0xd3c (P)    try_to_unmap_one+0x3dc/0xd3c (L)    rmap_walk_anon+0xdc/0x1f8    rmap_walk+0x3c/0x58    try_to_unmap+0x88/0x90    unmap_poisoned_folio+0x30/0xa8    do_migrate_range+0x4a0/0x568    offline_pages+0x5a4/0x670    memory_block_action+0x17c/0x374    memory_subsys_offline+0x3c/0x78    device_offline+0xa4/0xd0    state_store+0x8c/0xf0    dev_attr_store+0x18/0x2c    sysfs_kf_write+0x44/0x54    kernfs_fop_write_iter+0x118/0x1a8    vfs_write+0x3a8/0x4bc    ksys_write+0x6c/0xf8    __arm64_sys_write+0x1c/0x28    invoke_syscall+0x44/0x100    el0_svc_common.constprop.0+0x40/0xe0    do_el0_svc+0x1c/0x28    el0_svc+0x30/0xd0    el0t_64_sync_handler+0xc8/0xcc    el0t_64_sync+0x198/0x19c   ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---  [mawupeng1@huawei.com: unmap_poisoned_folio(): remove shadowed local `mapping', per Miaohe]","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21907","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05108,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0125},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21907"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-21927","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-21927","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  nvme-tcp: fix potential memory corruption in nvme_tcp_recv_pdu()  nvme_tcp_recv_pdu() doesn't check the validity of the header length.

When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds tpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:  vhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg); ...  kfree(vs->vs_tpg); vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;  If vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found match=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the pointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:  kfree(vs->vs_tpg); vs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;  If a scsi request is then sent we do:  vhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend  which sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.  2. Tpg dir removal hang:  This patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer tpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount dropping to -1.  The problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already in the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so target_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do target_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their refcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added in the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in previous calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.  Later, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do target_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop their refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg and will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.  3. Tpg leak:  This fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be un-removable because the target name is overwritten when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different target names.  The bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup a vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we haven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this happens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite the target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's name and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the vs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing target_undepend_item on the tpgs.  Because of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call vhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major user, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the issues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called if it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the tpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint first.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-22083","epss":0.00026,"percentile":0.05386,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.013},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-22083"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22090","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-22090","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  x86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()  If track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple tree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over the dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied any page tables.  Consequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the PAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page table was not copied.  The easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA if track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\" clearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy() and performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll simply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ... which is also wrong.  So let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation succeeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if anything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT flag after undoing the reservation.  Note that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will get removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set then, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be happy. Note that leaving these page tables in place without a reservation is not a problem, as we are aborting fork(); this process will never run.

Let's say Thread A is trying to detach a device from a bridge and Thread B is trying to remove the bridge.  In dev_ioctl(), Thread A bumps the bridge device's refcnt by netdev_hold() and releases RTNL because the following br_ioctl_call() also re-acquires RTNL.  In the race window, Thread B could acquire RTNL and try to remove the bridge device.  Then, rtnl_unlock() by Thread B will release RTNL and wait for netdev_put() by Thread A.  Thread A, however, must hold RTNL after the unlock in dev_ifsioc(), which may take long under RTNL pressure, resulting in the splat by Thread B.

In the dev_ioctl() path, we do the following:    1. Copy struct ifreq by get_user_ifreq in sock_do_ioctl()   2. Check CAP_NET_ADMIN in dev_ioctl()   3. Call dev_load() in dev_ioctl()   4. Fetch the master dev from ifr.ifr_name in dev_ifsioc()  3. can be done by request_module() in br_ioctl_call(), so we move 1., 2., and 4. to br_ioctl_stub().  Note that 2. is also checked later in add_del_if(), but it's better performed before RTNL.  SIOCBRADDIF and SIOCBRDELIF have been processed in dev_ioctl() since the pre-git era, and there seems to be no specific reason to process them there.

As a result, it is possible for a block group to go unused and have 'btrfs_mark_bg_unused' called on it concurrently with 'btrfs_create_pending_block_groups'. This causes a number of issues, which were fixed with the block group flag 'BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW'.  However, this fix is not quite complete. Since it does not use the unused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:  btrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused                                            if list_empty // false         list_del_init         clear_bit                                            else if (test_bit) // true                                                 list_move_tail  And we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs state for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to prevent.

When I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two LOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]  Reproduction Steps:    1) Mount CIFS   2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS   3) Unmount CIFS   4) Unload the CIFS module   5) Remove the iptables rule  At step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying TCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in FIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.  At this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still alive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.    # ss -tan   State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port   FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445    # lsmod | grep cifs   cifs                 1159168  0  This highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module and the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release() and it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to close the connection gracefully.  While this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because CIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk->sk_lock using sock_lock_init_class_and_name().  Once an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires, sk->sk_lock is acquired.  Then, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where hlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since the module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning and returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.  If LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling sock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded while such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.  Let's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().  Note that sock_lock_init() clears sk->sk_owner for svc_create_socket() that calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket, which clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.

the task_work_cancel() failure and the hang on rcuwait_wait_event().

Some adjustments are necessary to make it work:  * A child event might dereference its parent upon freeing. Care must be   taken to release the parent last.  * Some places assuming the event doesn't have any reference held and   therefore can be freed right away must instead put the reference and   let the reference counting to its job.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37747","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05256,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0125},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37747"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37750","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37750","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  smb: client: fix UAF in decryption with multichannel  After commit f7025d861694 (\"smb: client: allocate crypto only for primary server\") and commit b0abcd65ec54 (\"smb: client: fix UAF in async decryption\"), the channels started reusing AEAD TFM from primary channel to perform synchronous decryption, but that can't done as there could be multiple cifsd threads (one per channel) simultaneously accessing it to perform decryption.

After \"complete\" becomes true, dsa_tree_setup_cpu_ports() or any subsequent function may fail. If that happens, the entire tree setup is in limbo: the first N-1 switches have successfully finished probing (doing nothing but having allocated persistent memory in the tree's dst->ports, and maybe dst->rtable), and switch N failed to probe, ending the tree setup process before anything is tangible from the user's PoV.  If switch N fails to probe, its memory (ports) will be freed and removed from dst->ports.

The deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in dsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be called from the tree setup error path.  In my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added dsa_link elements to dst->rtable. Prior to that, each switch had its own ds->rtable which is freed when the switch fails to probe.

A simple curl to a HTTP backend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large packet sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request) while others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.  In fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the node with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire for the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been 152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes was padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we saw user/payload data from prior processed packets).  We only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and the backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request got dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even though the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to the MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let the curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the padding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).  Commit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager to also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs to stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor. The latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and it indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end} parts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the relevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the xdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on the wire looks good again.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37799","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05256,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0125},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37799"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37800","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37800","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  driver core: fix potential NULL pointer dereference in dev_uevent()  If userspace reads \"uevent\" device attribute at the same time as another threads unbinds the device from its driver, change to dev->driver from a valid pointer to NULL may result in crash.

 Note that the whole htab_elem alignment is 8 (for x86_64). If the key_size is 4, that means pptr is stored in a location which is 4 byte aligned but not 8 byte aligned. In mm/kmemleak.c, scan_block() scans the memory based on 8 byte stride, so it won't detect above pptr, hence reporting the memory leak.  In htab_map_alloc(), we already have          htab->elem_size = sizeof(struct htab_elem) +                           round_up(htab->map.key_size, 8);         if (percpu)                 htab->elem_size += sizeof(void *);         else                 htab->elem_size += round_up(htab->map.value_size, 8);  So storing pptr with 8-byte alignment won't cause any problem and can fix kmemleak too.  The issue can be reproduced with bpf selftest as well:   1. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK config   2. Add a getchar() before skel destroy in test_hash_map() in prog_tests/for_each.c.      The purpose is to keep map available so kmemleak can be detected.   3. run './test_progs -t for_each/hash_map &' and a kmemleak should be reported.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37807","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.04803,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37807"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37819","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37819","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  irqchip/gic-v2m: Prevent use after free of gicv2m_get_fwnode()  With ACPI in place, gicv2m_get_fwnode() is registered with the pci subsystem as pci_msi_get_fwnode_cb(), which may get invoked at runtime during a PCI host bridge probe.

As such, it only makes sense to be extremely vocal when those assumptions are violated and the driver unbinds with entries still present.  But Ido Schimmel points out a very simple situation where that is wrong: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/ZDazSM5UsPPjQuKr@shredder/ (also briefly discussed by me in the aforementioned commit).  Basically, while the bridge bypass operations are not something that DSA explicitly documents, and for the majority of DSA drivers this API simply causes them to go to promiscuous mode, that isn't the case for all drivers. Some have the necessary requirements for bridge bypass operations to do something useful - see dsa_switch_supports_uc_filtering().  Although in tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/local_termination.sh, we made an effort to popularize better mechanisms to manage address filters on DSA interfaces from user space - namely macvlan for unicast, and setsockopt(IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP) - through mtools - for multicast, the fact is that 'bridge fdb add ... self static local' also exists as kernel UAPI, and might be useful to someone, even if only for a quick hack.  It seems counter-productive to block that path by implementing shim .ndo_fdb_add and .ndo_fdb_del operations which just return -EOPNOTSUPP in order to prevent the ndo_dflt_fdb_add() and ndo_dflt_fdb_del() from running, although we could do that.  Accepting that cleanup is necessary seems to be the only option. Especially since we appear to be coming back at this from a different angle as well. Russell King is noticing that the WARN_ON() triggers even for VLANs: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/Z_li8Bj8bD4-BYKQ@shell.armlinux.org.uk/  What happens in the bug report above is that dsa_port_do_vlan_del() fails, then the VLAN entry lingers on, and then we warn on unbind and leak it.  This is not a straight revert of the blamed commit, but we now add an informational print to the kernel log (to still have a way to see that bugs exist), and some extra comments gathered from past years' experience, to justify the logic.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37864","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05256,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0125},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37864"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37870","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37870","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  drm/amd/display: prevent hang on link training fail  [Why] When link training fails, the phy clock will be disabled.

Ensure that child_event->ctx is non-NULL before any subsequent error path within inherit_event calls free_event(), satisfying the assumptions of the cleanup code.  Details:  There's no clear Fixes tag, because this bug is a side-effect of multiple interacting commits over time (up to 15 years old), not a single regression.  The code initially incremented refcount then assigned context immediately after the child_event was created. Later, an early validity check for child_event was added before the refcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was added, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid. The problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial check passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its precondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after its initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any subsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().  To resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment directly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the parent event is orphaned. The cleanup routine depends on event->pmu_ctx being non-NULL before it verifies event->ctx is non-NULL. This also maintains the author's original intent of passing in child_ctx to find_get_pmu_context before its refcount/assignment.

Fix this by inserting a nop insn.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37893","epss":0.00015,"percentile":0.01943,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.007874999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"none (unknown)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37893"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37897","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37897","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  wifi: plfxlc: Remove erroneous assert in plfxlc_mac_release  plfxlc_mac_release() asserts that mac->lock is held. This assertion is incorrect, because even if it was possible, it would not be the valid behaviour. The function is used when probe fails or after the device is disconnected. In both cases mac->lock can not be held as the driver is not working with the device at the moment. All functions that use mac->lock unlock it just after it was held. There is also no need to hold mac->lock for plfxlc_mac_release() itself, as mac data is not affected, except for mac->flags, which is modified atomically.

This happens when copying the coredump segment list in bnxt_hwrm_dbg_dma_data() with the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST FW command. The info->dest_buf buffer is allocated based on the number of coredump segments returned by the FW.  The segment list is then DMA'ed by the FW and the length of the DMA is returned by FW.  The driver then copies this DMA'ed segment list to info->dest_buf.  In some cases, this DMA length may exceed the info->dest_buf length and cause the above BUG condition.  Fix it by capping the copy length to not exceed the length of info->dest_buf.  The extra DMA data contains no useful information.  This code path is shared for the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_LIST and the HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE FW commands.  The buffering is different for these 2 FW commands.  To simplify the logic, we need to move the line to adjust the buffer length for HWRM_DBG_COREDUMP_RETRIEVE up, so that the new check to cap the copy length will work for both commands.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37911","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.07652,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.140-1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5925-1"}],"risk":0.016},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 6.1.140-1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37911"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.140-1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37912","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37912","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  ice: Check VF VSI Pointer Value in ice_vc_add_fdir_fltr()  As mentioned in the commit baeb705fd6a7 (\"ice: always check VF VSI pointer values\"), we need to perform a null pointer check on the return value of ice_get_vf_vsi() before using it.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37912","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.07652,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.140-1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5925-1"}],"risk":0.016},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 6.1.140-1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37912"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.140-1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37913","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37913","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: qfq: Fix double list add in class with netem as child qdisc  As described in Gerrard's report [1], there are use cases where a netem child qdisc will make the parent qdisc's enqueue callback reentrant.

Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn't take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the check is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid string is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str will be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer which size is 256.  The same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with length 250.  Check the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent buffer overflow.

This turned out to be because we were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects all metadata writes.  When writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty range.  If the range isn't dirty we do  \tbit_start++;  to move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the number of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k pagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4 bits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per page.  To make this easier this is how everything looks  [0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address [0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset [               64k page               ] folio [ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers [ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap  Now we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so as you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.  When we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start += sectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the next eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.  However if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now put us offset from our radix tree entries.  In our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is not dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop around and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that start using the following equation  \tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;  so in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start as  \t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096 \t4096 >> 12 = 1  Now we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb. What's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start += sectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into the same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the radix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.  The best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes, but that's a larger change.

When generating the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value that will be loaded on VM-Entry to a KVM guest, mask the value with the vCPU's desired PEBS_ENABLE value.  Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in running the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use PEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply looking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host userspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.  Running the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as crashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't written MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when trying to record PEBS events.  The issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before commit 7b100989b4f6 (\"perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default\") (after which, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).\tThe userspace side of perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs() misconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.  Arguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events simply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there is no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad userspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to guest-owned events.  Note, commit 854250329c02 (\"KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily in two rare situations\") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling KVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only KVM.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37936","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.04719,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.140-1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5925-1"}],"risk":0.012},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 6.1.140-1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37936"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.140-1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37942","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37942","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  HID: pidff: Make sure to fetch pool before checking SIMULTANEOUS_MAX  As noted by Anssi some 20 years ago, pool report is sometimes messed up.

Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from    their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz 2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.  For type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(), and dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start(). These seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because that is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the biggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.  Talking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which do not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs, mdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full), I have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is triggered:  \tWARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY && \t\tphydev->state != PHY_UP);  because the PHY state machine is running.  It's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... -> phylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.  The previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called phy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state PHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.  mdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for phylink, the phydev->adjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a technicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state machine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink existed, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which don't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY. But phylink itself has historically not been developed with suspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that scenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior to the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.  This issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to the above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC driver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where the issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a quick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:  $ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm drivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx.c drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/sparx5/sparx5_main.c drivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/dpaa2-mac.c drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/fs_enet-main.c drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/ucc_geth.c drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_pf_common.c drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_main.c drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/prestera/prestera_main.c drivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c drivers/net/ethernet/altera/altera_tse_main.c drivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/txgbe/txgbe_phy.c drivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/fbnic_phylink.c drivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40_phy.c drivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c  Make the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a phydev->phy_link_change() implementation equal to the default phy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that the phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and when phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/ started on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that if phydev->phy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the kernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.

However, the commit did not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).

SHUTDOWN on SVM is a weird edge case where KVM needs to do _something_ sane with the VMCB, since it's technically undefined, and INIT is the least awful choice given KVM's ABI.  So, double down on stuffing INIT on SHUTDOWN, and force the vCPU out of SMM to avoid any weirdness (and the WARN).  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

But should_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by widening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.  Long Version:  === History ===  There were a few things leading up to this.  First, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was made lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs due to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull mm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive and skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are again.  === Problem ===  The too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:  \t// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only \t// if should_flush_tlb() agrees: \tcpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));  \tnext_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen); \tchoose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush); \tload_new_mm_cr3(need_flush); \t// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST* \t// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.          this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next); \t// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb() \t// become true!  should_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3() and writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be suppressed.  Whoops.  === Solution ===  Thankfully, the fuzzy \"just about to write CR3\" window is already marked with loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in should_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with an IPI.  This will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small and I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance impact.  Update the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew yet another user.  Peter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe 'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off() writes them.  Add a barrier to ensure that they are observed in the order they are written.","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37964","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.07652,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.140-1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5925-1"}],"risk":0.016},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 6.1.140-1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37964"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.140-1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37967","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37967","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix deadlock  This patch introduces the ucsi_con_mutex_lock / ucsi_con_mutex_unlock functions to the UCSI driver. ucsi_con_mutex_lock ensures the connector mutex is only locked if a connection is established and the partner pointer is valid.

Dave analyzed it, and it happens because glibc uses a double-word floating-point store to atomically update function descriptors. As a result of lazy binding, we hit a floating-point store in fpe_func almost immediately.  When the T bit is set, an assist exception trap occurs when when the co-processor encounters *any* floating-point instruction except for a double store of register %fr0.  The latter cancels all pending traps.  Let's fix this by clearing the Trap (T) bit in the FP status register before returning to the signal handler in userspace.  The issue can be reproduced with this test program:  root@parisc:~# cat fpe.c  static void fpe_func(int sig, siginfo_t *i, void *v) {         sigset_t set;         sigemptyset(&set);         sigaddset(&set, SIGFPE);         sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &set, NULL);         printf(\"GOT signal %d with si_code %ld\\n\", sig, i->si_code); }  int main() {         struct sigaction action = {                 .sa_sigaction = fpe_func,                 .sa_flags = SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO };         sigaction(SIGFPE, &action, 0);         feenableexcept(FE_OVERFLOW);         return printf(\"%lf\\n\",1.7976931348623158E308*1.7976931348623158E308); }  root@parisc:~# gcc fpe.c -lm root@parisc:~# ./a.out  Floating point exception  root@parisc:~# strace -f ./a.out  execve(\"./a.out\", [\"./a.out\"], 0xf9ac7034 /* 20 vars */) = 0  getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, {rlim_cur=8192*1024, rlim_max=RLIM_INFINITY}) = 0  ...  rt_sigaction(SIGFPE, {sa_handler=0x1110a, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO}, NULL, 8) = 0  --- SIGFPE {si_signo=SIGFPE, si_code=FPE_FLTOVF, si_addr=0x1078f} ---  --- SIGFPE {si_signo=SIGFPE, si_code=FPE_FLTOVF, si_addr=0xf8f21237} ---  +++ killed by SIGFPE +++  Floating point exception","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-37991","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.07652,"date":"2025-06-12"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.1.140-1"],"state":"fixed"},"advisories":[{"id":"","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5925-1"}],"risk":0.016},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","package":{"name":"linux","version":"6.1.137-1"}},"found":{"versionConstraint":"< 6.1.140-1 (deb)","vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-37991"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.1.140-1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"Package-deb-linux-libc-dev-ef5d9fe9eda659fd","name":"linux-libc-dev","version":"6.1.137-1","type":"deb","locations":null,"language":"","licenses":["BSD-2-Clause AND LicenseRef-CRYPTOGAMS AND GPL-2.0-only AND LicenseRef-GPL-2--or-X11 AND LGPL-2.1-only AND LicenseRef-Unicode-data AND LicenseRef-Xen-interface"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc-dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc_dev:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux-libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux_libc:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux-libc-dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linux:linux_libc_dev:6.1.137-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/linux-libc-dev@6.1.137-1?arch=arm64&distro=debian-12&upstream=linux","upstreams":[{"name":"linux"}]},"appliedIgnoreRules":[{"namespace":"","package":{"name":"linux-libc-dev","language":"","type":"deb","upstream-name":"linux"},"match-type":"exact-indirect-match"}]},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-37992","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-37992","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Unknown","urls":[],"description":"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:  net_sched: Flush gso_skb list too during ->change()  Previously, when reducing a qdisc's limit via the ->change() operation, only the main skb queue was trimmed, potentially leaving packets in the gso_skb list.

The patch only checks the cl->cl_nactive field to determine whether     it is the first insertion or not [2], but this field is only     incremented by init_vf [3].      By using HFSC_RSC (which uses init_ed) [4], it is possible to bypass the     check and insert the class twice in the eltree.     Under normal conditions, this would lead to an infinite loop in     hfsc_dequeue for the reasons we already explained in this report [5].      However, if TBF is added as root qdisc and it is configured with a     very low rate,     it can be utilized to prevent packets from being dequeued.     This behavior can be exploited to perform subsequent insertions in the     HFSC eltree and cause a UAF.\"  To fix both the UAF and the infinite loop, with netem as an hfsc child, check explicitly in hfsc_enqueue whether the class is already in the eltree whenever the HFSC_RSC flag is set.

When multiple threads or VFs try to access the same registers simultaneously, it can lead to race conditions. By using the RLCG interface, the driver can serialize access to the registers. This means that only one thread can access the registers at a time, preventing conflicts and ensuring that operations are performed correctly.

What am I trying to do:  This patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure handling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as compared to 5.10 LTS.      - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space     - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space  ## 2. What is the expected outcome and why  - For copyin case:  Kernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or copy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return -EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler checks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be recovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code specified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.  - For instr case:  If a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery is possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills by reading from storage.   ## 3. What actually happens and why  - For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17  Commit 4c132d1d844a (\"x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage\") introduced a new extable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the extable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from EX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS handling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().  - For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI   and #MCE race  When an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the CMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA signature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when the data is about to be consumed.  ### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]  Prior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that detected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a broadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action Optional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because it's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that bad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE interrupts and finally become an IERR.  Hence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub from SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to #CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in uc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA* signature name.  ### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in     Intel platform [1]  Having decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors, the memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is executing asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference between a \"real\" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if an error is found in any read.  Thus:  1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a    speculative read.  2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read    request  3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the    core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.
